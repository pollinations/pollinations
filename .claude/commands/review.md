Review a PR or code changes.

Focus on:
- Parts that need improving (not what's already good)
- Be concise and information-dense
- Bullet points only
- State facts, not opinions
- Link to specific lines/files

**Don't:**
- Praise code that's fine
- Write long paragraphs
- Repeat obvious things
- Use marketing language

**Format:**
```
## Issues
- [file:line] Brief description of problem
- [file:line] Another issue

## Suggestions
- Consider X instead of Y
- Missing error handling for Z
```
