# Agent Guidelines for Pollinations.AI

## Project Submission Handling

When handling project submission issues (labeled as **APPS** in GitHub):

1. Add new projects to the appropriate category file in:
   - pollinations.ai/src/config/projects/[category].js (e.g., creative.js, vibeCoding.js, etc.)
   - DO NOT manually edit the README.md file directly
   - After adding projects, regenerate the lists by running:
     ```bash
     node pollinator-agent/project-list-scripts/generate-project-table.js --update-readme
     ```

2. Project Entry Format:
   ```javascript
   {
     name: "Project Name",
     url: "https://project-url.com", // REQUIRED - working project URL
     description: "Brief description of the project.",
     author: "@discord_username", // if available or alternatively a URL to a social media profile
     repo: "https://github.com/repo-url", // OPTIONAL - GitHub repo if available
     submissionDate: "YYYY-MM-DD", // automatically added for new submissions
     language: "zh-CN", // for non-English projects, include the language code
     hidden: true, // optional, set to true for broken projects that shouldn't appear in README.md
     order: 1 // ordering priority based on status (1=highest, 5=lowest)
   }
   ```

3. Project Ordering Rules:
   - In the README.md file, projects should be ordered within their categories:
     - First by the `order` parameter (lower values first: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
     - Then by GitHub star count (higher star counts first)
     - For projects with the same order and no stars, use the submission date if there is one, if not keep the order as it is.
   - In the website rendering, the projectList.js order will be dynamically sorted using the same criteria so the actual order in the projectList.js file should not be changed

4. Hiding Broken Projects:
   - Set `hidden: true` for broken/unmaintained projects
   - Hidden projects excluded from README.md but remain in projectList.js

5. GitHub Star Counts:
   - Add `stars` property for GitHub repos
   - Update counts: `node .github/scripts/update-project-stars.js [owner/repo]`

6. Categories (as of June 2025):
   - Vibe Coding ‚ú® (`vibeCoding.js`): No-code / describe-to-code playgrounds and builders
   - Creative üé® (`creative.js`): Turn prompts into images, video, music, design, slides
   - Games üé≤ (`games.js`): AI-powered play, interactive fiction, puzzle & agent worlds
   - Hack-&-Build üõ†Ô∏è (`hackAndBuild.js`): SDKs, integration libs, extensions, dashboards, MCP servers
   - Chat üí¨ (`chat.js`): Standalone chat UIs / multi-model playgrounds
   - Social Bots ü§ñ (`socialBots.js`): Discord / Telegram / WhatsApp / Roblox bots & NPCs
   - Learn üìö (`learn.js`): Tutorials, guides, style books & educational demos
   - (Tracking file: `tracking/toProcess.md` for workflow management)

## Classification Guidelines
- One category per project (no duplicates)
- Based on actual functionality, not source JSON category
- Prefer less-populated categories for balance
- Track uncategorized in `tracking/toProcess.md`
- Source of truth: `accumulated-projects.json`

**Category Mapping:**
- `learn.js`: Educational/interactive learning
- `hackAndBuild.js`: SDKs, APIs, toolkits
- `creative.js`: Image/text/audio generation
- `chat.js`: Chatbots, conversational agents
- `games.js`: Games, interactive fiction
- `socialBots.js`: Platform bots (Discord/Telegram/etc)

7. Add UTF-8 icons to titles (ü§ñ bots, üé® creative, etc.)

8. Non-English projects:
   - Add country flag emoji (üá®üá≥, üá™üá∏, etc.)
   - Include `language` field with language code
   - Add English translation in parentheses

9. Commit attribution:
   ```
   Add [Project Name] to [category]
   
   Co-authored-by: [Username] <[user_id]+[username]@users.noreply.github.com>
   Closes #[Issue]
   ```

## Repository Structure

Key directories and their purposes:

```
pollinations/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image.pollinations.ai/     # Image generation backend service
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ text.pollinations.ai/      # Text generation backend service
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pollinations.ai/           # Main React frontend application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pollinations-react/        # React component library
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model-context-protocol/    # MCP server for AI assistant integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ enter.pollinations.ai/     # New centralized auth gateway (BETA)

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ operations/                # Documentation and operations
```

## API Gateway Transition (Important)

**We are currently running two API systems simultaneously:**

### üÜï **enter.pollinations.ai** (NEW - Beta)
Our new centralized authentication and model gateway:
- **Status**: Beta - actively being rolled out
- **Features**: Unified authentication, pollen-based billing, all models in one place
- **Authentication**: Publishable keys (`pk_`) and Secret keys (`sk_`)
- **Endpoints** (transitional - will be simplified): 
  - `/api/generate/image/*` - Image generation with all models
  - `/api/generate/openai` - OpenAI-compatible text/audio endpoints
  - `/api/generate/text/*` - Simple text generation
- **Documentation**: See `enter.pollinations.ai/MODEL-TESTING-CHEATSHEET.md`
- **Best for**: New integrations, testing, production-ready features
- **Note**: Current endpoint structure is transitional and will be simplified in future releases

### üîÑ **Legacy APIs** (OLD - Being Phased Out)
- **image.pollinations.ai** - Direct image generation (no auth)
- **text.pollinations.ai** - Direct text generation (no auth)
- **auth.pollinations.ai** - Original authentication service
- **Status**: Still operational but will be deprecated in favor of enter.pollinations.ai
- **Migration**: All new features are being built on enter.pollinations.ai

**For Agents**: When working on API-related tasks, clarify whether you're working with:
1. **New system** (enter.pollinations.ai) - preferred for new work
2. **Legacy system** (image/text.pollinations.ai) - maintenance only

Both systems are currently functional, but new development should target enter.pollinations.ai.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The `model-context-protocol/` directory contains a Model Context Protocol server that allows AI agents to directly generate images, text, and audio using the Pollinations API.

For detailed implementation notes, design principles, and troubleshooting, see:
- `model-context-protocol/README.md` - Installation and usage
- `model-context-protocol/AGENTS.md` - Implementation guidelines and debugging

## Development Guidelines

1. Code Style:
   - Use modern JavaScript/TypeScript features
   - Use ES modules (import/export) - all .js files are treated as ES modules
   - Follow existing code formatting patterns
   - Add descriptive comments for complex logic

2. Testing:
   - Add tests for new features in appropriate test directories
   - Follow existing test patterns in /test directories
   - **Test with real production code, not mocks** - Tests should validate actual behavior
   - Avoid creating mock infrastructure - use direct function imports instead

3. Documentation:
   - Update API docs for new endpoints
   - Add JSDoc comments for new functions
   - Update README.md for user-facing changes
   - **Avoid creating markdown documentation files while working** unless explicitly requested
   - If temporary files are needed for testing/debugging, create them in a `temp/` folder clearly labeled as temporary

4. YAGNI Principle (You Aren't Gonna Need It):
   - **Don't keep code for "potential futures"** - Only implement what's needed now
   - Remove unused functions, even if they "might be useful someday"
   - If we need something later, we'll add it when we actually need it
   - Example: Don't create test utilities or helper functions "just in case"
   - Keep the codebase minimal and focused on current requirements

5. Architecture Considerations:
   - Frontend changes should be in pollinations.ai/
   - Image generation in image.pollinations.ai/
   - Text generation in text.pollinations.ai/
   - React components in pollinations-react/
   - AI assistant integrations in model-context-protocol/

6. Security:
   - Never expose API keys or secrets
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Implement proper input validation

## Common Tasks

1. Adding New Models:
   - Update models list in respective service
   - Add model configuration
   - Update API documentation

2. Frontend Updates:
   - Follow React best practices
   - Use existing UI components
   - Maintain responsive design

3. API Changes:
   - Maintain backward compatibility
   - Update documentation
   - Add appropriate error handling

4. API Documentation Guidelines:
   - Keep documentation strictly technical and user-focused
   - Avoid marketing language or promotional content
   - Link to dynamic endpoints (like /models) rather than hardcoding lists that may change
   - Don't include internal implementation details or environment variables
   - Focus on endpoints, parameters, and response formats
   - For new features, document both simplified endpoints and OpenAI-compatible endpoints
   - Include minimal, clear code examples that demonstrate basic usage

# Git Workflow
- If the user asks to send to git or something similar do all these steps:
- Git status, diff, create branch, commit all, push and write a PR description

## Communication Style

**All PRs, comments, issues: bullet points, <200 words, no fluff**

**PR Format:**
- Use "- Adds X", "- Fix Y" format
- 3-5 bullets for most PRs
- Simple titles: "fix:", "feat:", "Add"
- Reference: `repo:pollinations/pollinations author:eulervoid`

## GitHub Labels

- Only use established labels (check with `mcp1_list_issues`)
- Avoid creating new labels unless part of broader strategy
- Keep names consistent with existing patterns

## Contributor Attribution

**Commit format:**
```
feat: add feature

Co-authored-by: username <user_id+username@users.noreply.github.com>
Fixes #issue
```

- Use "Fixes #issue" or "Addresses #issue" in PR descriptions
- Email format: `{username} <{user_id}+{username}@users.noreply.github.com>`
- Find user_id in issue API response
