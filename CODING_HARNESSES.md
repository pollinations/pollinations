# Coding Harnesses

Use `polli harness` to connect a supported coding harness to Pollinations. It handles Polli login, a dedicated API key, model setup, and any Pollinations capabilities supported by that harness.

> **Available now:** Bloom CLI, Claude Code Router, Codex Router, DeepSeek Harness, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Pi, and Prime Agent are integrated `polli harness` profiles.

## Use a harness

Every integrated harness follows the same lifecycle:

```bash
polli harness --help
polli harness <harness> on
polli harness <harness> status
polli harness <harness> off
```

- `on` first checks that the harness can be launched, then connects it to Pollinations.
- `status` shows whether the harness is ready to use Pollinations.
- `off` removes only the Pollinations setup and preserves unrelated configuration.

If a harness cannot be launched, `on` stops before login, key creation, or configuration and shows its official installation command. If Polli is not installed yet, run the first setup through `npx @pollinations/cli@latest`. Login uses the browser device flow by default. Each harness receives its own API key instead of reusing the account key stored by `polli auth login`.

## Update a harness

Polli configures harnesses; it does not update their installations. Use the harness's updater (or the package manager you installed it with), then rerun `polli harness <harness> on` to refresh the model catalog and configuration.

```bash
npm install -g @pollinations/cli@latest
uv tool upgrade bloom-cli
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh@latest web
opencode upgrade
openclaw update
pi update self
prime-agent update
```

Current OpenClaw requires Node `>=24.16.0 <25` or `>=26.1.0`; Pi requires Node `>=22.19.0`. Upgrade Node before updating either harness if needed. Bloom requires Python 3.12 or newer. Stop a running DSH server before launching its replacement, and back up saved sessions before a major harness upgrade.

## Harnesses

| Harness | Status | What is unique |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Bloom CLI](https://github.com/Ilm-Alan/bloom-cli) | **Available now** — `polli harness bloom on` | Creates a dedicated key for Bloom's existing Pollinations integration. |
| [Claude Code Router](https://github.com/musistudio/claude-code-router) | **Available now** — `polli harness claude-code on` | Registers a live Pollinations provider in Claude Code Router's SQLite config with a dedicated key; smoke-tests a real chat round-trip before finishing. |
| [Codex Router](https://github.com/duolahypercho/codex-router) | **Available now** — `polli harness codex on` | Registers a generic provider and credential in the router's state dir, then runs the router's own `client-setup codex` so `~/.codex/config.toml` points at the local gateway. |
| [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (`dsh`) | **Available now** — `polli harness dsh on` | Adds the Pollinations provider, hosted Pollinations MCP, and Polli skill. Uses `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` by default. Its official launch uses `npx`, so no separate global DSH installation is required. |
| [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) | **Available now** — `polli harness opencode on` | Uses the existing [Pollinations OpenCode plugin](https://github.com/fkom13/opencode-pollinations-plugin) for models, media tools, usage, and quests. Defaults to `openai/gpt-5.4-nano`. |
| [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) | **Available now** — `polli harness openclaw on` | Adds the Pollinations provider, a dedicated key, and the Polli skill, pulling models from the live catalog. Defaults to `moonshotai/kimi-k2.6`. |
| [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) | **Available now** — `polli harness pi on` | Uses Pi's native provider support and the Polli skill. Pi intentionally has no built-in MCP support. Defaults to `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`. |
| [Prime Agent](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-agent) | **Available now** — `polli harness prime on` | Uses native provider support and the Polli skill while preserving memories, sessions, and unrelated configuration. |

## Bloom CLI

```bash
uv tool install --python 3.12 bloom-cli
polli harness bloom on
bloom
```

Bloom already uses Pollinations for its models. `on` creates a dedicated key and stores it in `~/.bloom/.env` (or `$BLOOM_HOME/.env`); `off` restores the previous file or removes only that key if the file changed later.

## DeepSeek Harness

```bash
npx @pollinations/cli@latest harness dsh on
polli harness dsh status
polli harness dsh off
```

DeepSeek Harness is officially run with `npx @deepseek-ai/dsh@latest web`. The explicit `@latest` selects the current release rather than a local installation. `on` verifies that `npx` is available before changing configuration. Choose another default model with `--model <id>`. Add `--no-mcp` if you do not want the hosted Pollinations media tools.

## OpenCode

```bash
npx @pollinations/cli@latest harness opencode on
polli harness opencode status
polli harness opencode off
```

`on` requires OpenCode to be installed (`curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash`, `npm i -g opencode-ai`, or your package manager). It enables the existing [Pollinations OpenCode plugin](https://github.com/fkom13/opencode-pollinations-plugin) in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (or `$OPENCODE_CONFIG` / `$OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR`), stores a dedicated Pollinations API key in the plugin's own `config.json` (so no second login inside OpenCode is needed), and sets the default model to `pollinations/enter/openai/gpt-5.4-nano`. The plugin then serves the current Pollinations model catalog, media tools, usage, and `/poll quests` inside OpenCode. Choose another default with `--model <id>`; `off` removes only the plugin entry, the default model, and the stored key, leaving the rest of your OpenCode configuration untouched.

## OpenClaw

```bash
npx @pollinations/cli@latest harness openclaw on
polli harness openclaw status
polli harness openclaw off
```

`on` requires OpenClaw to be installed (`curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash`, or `openclaw.ai/install`). For a fresh install, it first creates OpenClaw's baseline config and workspace. It then adds a `pollinations` provider under `models.providers` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (or `$OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` / `$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` / `$OPENCLAW_HOME`), stores a dedicated Pollinations API key in `env.vars` and references it from the provider with OpenClaw's own `${VAR}` substitution, and sets the default model to `pollinations/moonshotai/kimi-k2.6` in `agents.defaults.model.primary`. The model list is pulled live from the Pollinations catalog (`--model <id>` to choose a different default). The Polli skill is installed under `~/.openclaw/skills/polli/` so the agent can generate images, audio, and video. Choose another default with `--model <id>`; `off` restores the previous config byte-for-byte, or (if you edited it) removes only the Pollinations provider, the key, a `pollinations/*` default model, and the skill, leaving unrelated settings untouched.

## Pi

```bash
npx @pollinations/cli@latest harness pi on
polli harness pi status
polli harness pi off
```

`on` requires Pi to be installed with its official npm command: `npm install -g --ignore-scripts @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`. It registers the current compatible Pollinations model catalog in `~/.pi/agent/models.json`, stores a dedicated key in `auth.json`, selects the startup model in `settings.json`, and installs the Polli skill under `skills/polli/`. Choose another default with `--model <id>`. Pi does not include built-in MCP support.

## Prime Agent

```bash
npx @pollinations/cli@latest harness prime on
polli harness prime status
polli harness prime off
```

`on` requires Prime Agent to be installed with its official installer. It registers the current compatible Pollinations model catalog in `~/.prime/agent/models.json`, stores a dedicated key in `auth.json`, selects the startup model in `settings.json`, and installs the Polli skill under `skills/polli/`. Choose another default with `--model <id>`.

## Claude Code Router

```bash
npm install -g @musistudio/claude-code-router
polli harness claude-code on
ccr code
```

`on` requires Claude Code Router (`ccr`) to be installed. It inserts a `pollinations` provider into the router's config database (`%APPDATA%/claude-code-router/config.sqlite` on Windows, `~/.claude-code-router/config.sqlite` elsewhere) using the router's native generic-provider schema (`@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` pointing at `https://gen.pollinations.ai/v1`), stores the dedicated Pollinations key in that provider, and registers the current compatible Pollinations model catalog. Default model is `qwen/qwen3.7-flash` (`--model <id>` to choose another; models whose id starts with a gateway type prefix such as `openai/` or `anthropic/` are rejected because the router treats the first path segment as its own provider-type namespace). Before finishing, `on` sends one real chat request through the router and reports the reply. `off` removes only the Pollinations provider, its key, and `pollinations/*` transformers entries, leaving the rest of your routing config untouched.

## Codex Router

```bash
git clone https://github.com/duolahypercho/codex-router
cd codex-router && ./install.ps1   # Windows; ./install.sh elsewhere
polli harness codex on
codex
```

`on` requires the Codex Router checkout (its CLI is `src/control.mjs` behind `bin/model-router`). It writes a generic provider into `user-models.json` and a credential into `generic-provider-credentials/` under the router's state dir (`~/.codex/codex-router/` by default, `$CODEX_ROUTER_STATE_DIR` override), with the dedicated Pollinations key stored outside `config.toml` — the router's own privacy rule. It then runs the router's official `client-setup codex`, which adds the managed `[model_providers.codex-router]` block and gateway base URL to `~/.codex/config.toml` (or `$CODEX_HOME`). If that config is already managed by another router (for example Claude Code Router), `on` stops without touching it. `off` runs the router's `client-remove codex` and deletes only the Pollinations provider and credential files.
