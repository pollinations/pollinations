# Contributing to pollinations.ai

Thank you for considering contributing to the pollinations.ai project! We are thrilled to have you join our community and help us enhance this exciting project. Your contributions are vital to improving our project and expanding its capabilities.

## How to Contribute

We have multiple projects under the `pollinations.ai` umbrella, and each project has its own set of issues. To make a meaningful contribution:

### 1. Explore Projects and Issues

Before you start, please refer to the main `README.md` file of the `pollinations.ai` repository. It lists all the insights and provides an overview. There are dedicated issues from versatile topics under the repository [Issues](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/issues) section.

Look for issues that interest you and feel free to tackle them!

### 2. Understand the Issue and Build an MVP

Once you've selected an issue, take the time to thoroughly understand its requirements. For code contributions, focus on building a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** that addresses the core problem or implements the key feature described in the issue.

### 3. Documentation Contributions

We are in profound need of members who can help enhance our documentation. If you possess experience in data science, machine learning, LLMs (Large Language Models), or Stable Diffusion, your insights will be invaluable. You can contribute by:

- Improving existing documentation to be clearer and more comprehensive.
- Writing new guides or tutorials that explain complex concepts or workflows.
- Providing practical examples of how to use different features of pollinations.ai.
- Creating explanations for the underlying data science and ML principles.

### 4. Build Apps with pollinations.ai

Want to build something cool? Check out our **[apps folder](./apps/README.md)**!

**How it works:**

1. **Propose your app idea** by creating a GitHub issue using the "SubmitApp" template
2. Describe what you want to build and which pollinations.ai APIs you'll use
3. Get feedback from maintainers
4. Build your app and submit a PR

Create apps using pollinations.ai APIs and get them featured. Each app lives in its own folder with clear docs. Perfect for:

- Creative tools (meme generators, art tools)
- Productivity apps (thumbnail creators, content generators)
- Fun projects (games, quizzes)
- Developer tools (API playgrounds, dashboards)

See the [apps README](./apps/README.md) for detailed guidelines and templates.

### 5. Code Contributions

If you're interested in coding, we enthusiastically welcome contributions in the following areas:

- **Bug Fixes:** Identifying and resolving issues that hinder the project's functionality.
- **Feature Enhancements:** Adding new capabilities or improving existing ones.
- **Code Optimization:** Refactoring and improving the efficiency, readability, and maintainability of the codebase.
- **New Functionalities:** Developing innovative features that expand the project's scope.

### How to earn the "pollinations.ai Contributor" badge

To earn this badge, contributors need to:

1. Submit at least one meaningful pull request that gets merged into the repository.
2. Ensure the pull request follows the project's contribution guidelines.
3. The contribution can be related to bug fixes, feature additions, or documentation improvements.

Once your pull request is merged, you will automatically be issued the badge!

## Getting Started

1.  **Fork the Repository**: Click on the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page to create your own copy of the project under your GitHub account.

2.  **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine. Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/pollinations.git
    ```

3.  **Create a Branch for Your Work**: Create a new branch for your specific contribution. It's good practice to name your branch related to the issue you're addressing (e.g., `fix/bug-description` or `feat/new-feature-name`).

    ```bash
    git checkout -b my-feature-branch
    ```

4.  **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes, focusing on the MVP for the chosen issue.

5.  **Commit Your Changes**: Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive message.

    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: Implement new feature for issue #XYZ"
    ```

    (Replace "XYZ" with the actual issue number)

6.  **Push Your Changes**: Push your local branch with your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

    ```bash
    git push origin my-feature-branch
    ```

7.  **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: Go to the original `pollinations/pollinations` repository on GitHub. You will see an option to create a Pull Request from your recently pushed branch.
    - **Crucially:** Link your PR to the original issue it addresses (e.g., "Closes #XYZ" in your PR description).
    - Ensure your PR clearly explains the changes you've made and how they resolve the issue.

## Guidelines

Follow the Coding Style: Write your code using the same style and rules that the project already uses. This helps keep the code consistent and easy to read for everyone.

Write Clear Commit Messages: When saving your changes (committing), write messages that clearly and simply explain what you did and why.

Document Your Changes Well: Add comments to your code where needed to explain how it works. If you are updating or adding documentation, make sure it is clear and accurate.

Test Your Work: If you can, write and run tests to check that your changes work correctly and do not break anything else.

Thank You! Thank you for contributing! Your help makes the pollinations.ai project stronger and more useful for the community. Happy coding!
