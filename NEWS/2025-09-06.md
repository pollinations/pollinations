# Weekly Update - 2025-09-06

- **Remove community model cost definitions** — Removed redundant cost definitions for community models like `unity`, `mirexa`, and `midijourney`. These models now inherit costs from underlying models via transform functions, simplifying configuration. [PR #3976](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/3976)
- **Add CVRON AI to Creative projects list** — Added CVRON AI, a Turkish image generator with `tr-TR` language support, to the Creative category in the project listings. [PR #3975](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/3975)
- **Add Ai image generator to Creative Projects** — Added a React-based AI image generator featuring custom controls for style, quality, and resolution to the Creative Projects category. [PR #3974](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/3974)
- **Update text.pollinations.ai root redirect** — Changed the root path redirect for `text.pollinations.ai` to point to the official API documentation on GitHub instead of the legacy community UI. [PR #3973](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/3973)
- **Finalize text generation refactor** — Completed the cleanup and finalization of the recent text generation system refactoring. [PR #3959](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/3959)
- **Refactor text generation transform system** — Eliminated hard-coded rules in `generateTextPortkey.js` and implemented a functional pipe system in `transforms/pipe.js` to streamline text generation logic. [PR #3958](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/3958)
- **Major text service refactoring** — Modularized configuration architecture, implemented transform functions for wrapped models, and simplified the `genericOpenAIClient` architecture by moving model-specific logic to Portkey. [PR #3954](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/3954)
- **Enforce strict cost data validation** — Removed `DEFAULT_COST` fallback and updated `resolveCost()` to throw explicit errors when model cost data is missing, ensuring pricing accuracy. [PR #3951](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/3951)
- **Extract pricing data module** — Extracted pricing data from `availableModels.js` into a dedicated `modelPricing.js` module and refactored internal terminology from "pricing" to "cost". [PR #3950](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/3950)
- **Text Service Updates & Infrastructure** — Updated OpenAI models to GPT-5 Nano, improved alias handling by converting string aliases to arrays, and updated pricing structures for various models. [PR #3947](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/3947)
- **Create SECURITY.md** — Added a security policy file to the repository. [PR #3905](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/3905)
- **Add AI Image Generator (ai-pic.site)** — Added a bilingual (Chinese/English) AI image generator with optimized prompt functions to the Creative Projects category. [PR #3914](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/3914)
- **Add AI Agent Portal to Hack & Build** — Added the AI Agent Portal, a multi-agent development environment for building complex projects, to the Hack & Build category. [PR #3925](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/3925)
