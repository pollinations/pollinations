# Weekly Update - 2025-11-22

- **Website Update Sync** — Fixes the website digest workflow to filter PRs merged into `main` in the past 7 days and automatically create a PR to update the website news section. [PR #5389](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/5389)
- **Frontend Image Model Handling** — Fixes a crash in the frontend by correctly processing `model.name` and `model.description` as objects rather than strings, resolving issues with the image model dropdown. [PR #5383](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/5383)
- **Automated Website News Updates** — Extends the weekly digest workflow to automatically generate and update website news using a new `.github/scripts/website_news_generator.py` script. [PR #5362](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/5362)
- **Kimi K2 Thinking Pricing Update** — Ends the free preview for `kimi-k2-thinking` and establishes new pricing at $0.60 input / $2.50 output per million tokens. [PR #5370](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/5370)
- **Model Renaming: Gemini Large** — Renames `gemini-3-pro` to `gemini-large` to align with model tier naming, while retaining `gemini-3-pro` as an alias for backward compatibility. [PR #5369](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/5369)
- **New Models: Kimi K2 & Gemini 3 Pro** — Adds `kimi-k2-thinking` (Moonshot AI reasoning model) and `gemini-3-pro` (Google's multimodal model) to the available model list. [PR #5367](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/5367)
- **Model Discovery Endpoint Refactor** — Updates `/api/generate/text/models` and `/api/generate/image/models` to expose `modelId` instead of aliases and consolidates metadata logic in the API gateway. [PR #5342](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/5342)
- **Cost Calculation Alignment** — Fixes discrepancies in cost and price calculations by ensuring the image service reports the actual model used (preventing silent fallbacks to `flux`) and removing hardcoded model references. [PR #5293](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/5293)
- **Model ID Updates & Test Coverage** — Updates IDs for `o4-mini`, `DeepSeek-V3.1`, and `grok-4-fast-non-reasoning`, adds `STOP` to `finish_reason` enum, and improves registry validation tests. [PR #5345](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/5345)
- **Text Integration Test Optimization** — Removes text service mocks to ensure tests hit the real backend, shortens prompts for speed, and fixes audio transcription tests. [PR #5343](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/5343)
- **Registry Code Cleanup** — Removes unused functions like `calculateMargins` and redundant exports (`TEXT_COSTS`, `IMAGE_COSTS`), and privatizes internal registry constants. [PR #5340](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/5340)
- **Auth Middleware Optimization** — Removes redundant authentication and rate-limit middleware from `/image/*` routes and standardizes the default text model parameter. [PR #5335](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/5335)
- **Type Safety Improvements** — Removes `as any` casts, updates `getModelDefinition` return types, and implements proper `CostDefinition` annotations for better type safety. [PR #5339](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/5339)
- **Registry Architecture Refactor** — Merges cost data directly into service definitions (`TEXT_SERVICES`, `IMAGE_SERVICES`) to create a single source of truth for model data. [PR #5333](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/5333)
- **Pricing System Update** — Removes the `free` flag and `isFreeService()` logic, requiring authentication and pollen balance for all requests, and standardizing cost-to-price calculations. [PR #5247](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/5247)
- **OpenAI Audio API Support** — Adds support for `input_audio` content type, `modalities` field (text/audio), and audio configuration parameters for transcription and TTS. [PR #5327](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/5327)
- **Publishable Key Beta Disclaimer** — Adds a UI warning for publishable key creation, advising the use of secret keys for stable production applications. [PR #5318](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/5318)
- **Model Voting UI** — Adds a "Vote on next models" button to the pricing section header to gather community feedback on desired models. [PR #5324](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/5324)
- **OpenAI Fast Model Update** — Updates `openai-fast` configuration to use `gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07` and corrects pricing to match official rates. [PR #5316](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/pull/5316)
