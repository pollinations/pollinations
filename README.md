### Image Generation

Here's an example of a generated image:

[![Conceptual Isometric World](https://pollinations.ai/p/3d_wireframe_blueprint_for_the_prompt_conceptual%20isometric%20world%20of%20pollinations%20ai%20surreal%20hyperrealistic%20digital%20garden?width=2000&height=500&nologo=true&seed=-1)](https://pollinations.ai/p/3d_wireframe_blueprint_for_the_prompt_conceptual%20isometric%20world%20of%20pollinations%20ai%20surreal%20hyperrealistic%20digital%20garden?width=2000&height=500&nologo=true&seed=-1)

Python code to download the generated image:

    import requests

    def download_image(prompt):
        url = f"https://pollinations.ai/p/{prompt}"
        response = requests.get(url)
        with open('generated_image.jpg', 'wb') as file:
            file.write(response.content)
        print('Image downloaded!')

    download_image("conceptual_isometric_world_of_pollinations_ai_surreal_hyperrealistic_digital_garden")
