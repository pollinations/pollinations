## 🚀 Getting Started

[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/pollinations/pollinations)

### Image Generation

```bash
curl 'https://gen.pollinations.ai/image/a%20beautiful%20sunset' -o image.jpg
```

Or visit [pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai) for an interactive experience.

### Text Generation

```bash
curl 'https://gen.pollinations.ai/text/Hello%20world'
```

### Audio Generation

**Simple GET endpoint:**

```bash
curl 'https://gen.pollinations.ai/audio/Hello%20from%20Pollinations?voice=nova&key=YOUR_API_KEY' -o speech.mp3
```

**OpenAI TTS compatible:**

```bash
curl 'https://gen.pollinations.ai/v1/audio/speech' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -d '{"model": "tts-1", "input": "Hello from Pollinations!", "voice": "nova"}' \
  -o speech.mp3
```

Available voices: `alloy`, `echo`, `fable`, `onyx`, `nova`, `shimmer`, plus [30+ ElevenLabs voices](https://enter.pollinations.ai/api/docs).

### MCP Server for AI Assistants

Our MCP (Model Context Protocol) server enables AI assistants like Claude to generate images and audio directly. [Learn more](./packages/mcp/README.md)

#### Configuration

Add this to your MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pollinations": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@pollinations/model-context-protocol"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Run with npx (no installation required)

```bash
npx @pollinations/model-context-protocol
```

Community alternatives like [MCPollinations](https://github.com/pinkpixel-dev/MCPollinations) and [Sequa MCP Server](https://mcp.sequa.ai/v1/pollinations/contribute) are also available.

AI assistants can:

- Generate images from text descriptions
- Create text-to-speech audio with various voice options
- Play audio responses through the system speakers
- Access all pollinations.ai models and services
- List available models, voices, and capabilities

For more advanced usage, check out our [API documentation](APIDOCS.md).

## 🔐 Authentication

Get your API key at [enter.pollinations.ai](https://enter.pollinations.ai)

### Key Types

| Key             | Prefix | Use Case                       | Rate Limits              | Status  |
| --------------- | ------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------- |
| **Publishable** | `pk_`  | Client-side, demos, prototypes | 1 pollen per IP per hour | ⚠️ Beta |
| **Secret**      | `sk_`  | Server-side only               | No rate limits           | Stable  |

> ⚠️ **Publishable keys:** Turnstile protection coming soon. Not recommended for production yet.

> ⚠️ **Never expose `sk_` keys** in client-side code, git repos, or public URLs

> 💡 **Building an app?** Use [Bring Your Own Pollen](./BRING_YOUR_OWN_POLLEN.md) — users pay for their own usage, you pay $0

### Model Restrictions

Each API key can be scoped to specific models. When creating a key at [enter.pollinations.ai](https://enter.pollinations.ai), you can:

- **Allow all models** — key works with any available model
- **Restrict to specific models** — select exactly which models the key can access (e.g., only `flux` and `openai`, or just `gptimage-large`)

### Usage

```bash
curl 'https://gen.pollinations.ai/image/a%20cat?key=YOUR_KEY'
```

**Environment variable (best practice):**

```bash
export POLLINATIONS_API_KEY=sk_...
```

See [full API docs](APIDOCS.md) for detailed authentication information.

        response = requests.get(url)
        with open('generated_image.jpg', 'wb') as file:
            file.write(response.content)
        print('Image downloaded!')

    download_image("conceptual_isometric_world_of_pollinations_ai_surreal_hyperrealistic_digital_garden")

### Text Generation

To generate text:

    https://gen.pollinations.ai/text/What%20is%20artificial%20intelligence?

### Audio Generation

Generate speech from text:

    https://gen.pollinations.ai/audio/Hello%20from%20Pollinations?voice=alloy&key=YOUR_API_KEY

Or use the OpenAI TTS-compatible endpoint:

```bash
curl 'https://gen.pollinations.ai/v1/audio/speech' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
