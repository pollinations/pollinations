## 🗂️ Project Structure

Our codebase is organized into several key folders, each serving a specific purpose in the Pollinations.AI ecosystem:

- [`pollinations.ai/`](./app/): The main React application for the Pollinations.ai website.

- [`image.pollinations.ai/`](./image.pollinations.ai/): Backend service for image generation and caching with Cloudflare Workers and R2 storage.

- [`pollinations-react/`](./pollinations-react/): React component library for Pollinations.ai.

- [`text.pollinations.ai/`](./text.pollinations.ai/): Backend service for text generation.

- [`model-context-protocol/`](./model-context-protocol/): Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for AI assistants like Claude to generate images directly.

This structure encompasses the frontend website, backend services for image and text generation, and integrations like the Discord bot and MCP server, providing a comprehensive framework for the Pollinations.AI platform.
