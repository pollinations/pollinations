## üñ•Ô∏è How to Use

### Web Interface

Our web interface is user-friendly and doesn't require any technical knowledge. Simply visit [https://pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai) and start creating!

### API

Use our API directly in your browser or applications:

    https://pollinations.ai/p/conceptual_isometric_world_of_pollinations_ai_surreal_hyperrealistic_digital_garden

Replace the description with your own, and you'll get a unique image based on your words!

## üé® Examples

### Image Generation

Here's an example of a generated image:

[![Conceptual Isometric World](https://pollinations.ai/p/3d_wireframe_blueprint_for_the_prompt_conceptual%20isometric%20world%20of%20pollinations%20ai%20surreal%20hyperrealistic%20digital%20garden?width=2000&height=500&nologo=true&seed=-1)](https://pollinations.ai/p/3d_wireframe_blueprint_for_the_prompt_conceptual%20isometric%20world%20of%20pollinations%20ai%20surreal%20hyperrealistic%20digital%20garden?width=2000&height=500&nologo=true&seed=-1)

Python code to download the generated image:

    import requests

    def download_image(prompt):
        url = f"https://pollinations.ai/p/{prompt}"
        response = requests.get(url)
        with open('generated_image.jpg', 'wb') as file:
            file.write(response.content)
        print('Image downloaded!')

    download_image("conceptual_isometric_world_of_pollinations_ai_surreal_hyperrealistic_digital_garden")

### Text Generation

To generate text, use this URL:

    https://text.pollinations.ai/What%20is%20artificial%20intelligence?

### Audio Generation

To generate audio from text, use this URL:

    https://text.pollinations.ai/Welcome%20to%20Pollinations?model=openai-audio&voice=nova

## üõ†Ô∏è Integration

### React Hooks

We offer React hooks for easy integration. Example usage:

    import React from 'react';
    import { usePollinationsImage, usePollinationsText } from '@pollinations/react';
    import ReactMarkdown from 'react-markdown';

    const AIGeneratedContent = () => {
      const imageUrl = usePollinationsImage("Beautiful landscape of Paris with Eiffel Tower", { width: 800, height: 600, seed: 42 });
      const markdown = usePollinationsText("Write a brief travel guide for Paris, including top attractions and local cuisine in markdown", { seed: 42 });

      return (
        <div>
          <h2>AI-Generated Travel Guide</h2>
          <img src={imageUrl} alt="AI Generated" />
          {markdown ? (
            <ReactMarkdown>{markdown}</ReactMarkdown>
          ) : (
            <p>Loading markdown content...</p>
          )}
        </div>
      );
    };

    export default AIGeneratedContent;
