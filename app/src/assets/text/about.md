##### About

Pollinations is a platform to generate media with the help of AI. Here you can create customized, royalty-free pieces of audio, images, 3D objects and soon fully immersive 3D environments on the fly.

We offer cutting-edge AI models that are constantly being updated. Every creation is unique and free to use.

&nbsp;

##### Why

The need to design digital worlds is rising fast, but the power and skills to actually build these worlds are concentrated in the hands of a few people.The cost is so high, and the process too time-consuming, making experimentation difficult. We believe the metaverse should be trippy, and we want it to be built by diverse minds, so **we developed an interface that makes AI media creation easy and fast**.


&nbsp;
