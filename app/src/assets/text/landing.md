###### For companies

Imagine you’re a metaverse or gaming platform in which players can **create 3D objects** just by typing a few words, or a marketplace in which users can create and mint NFTs on the spot. Not bad, huh?

By integrating with **Pollinations’ API**, users can create all of this and much more without switching platforms.
We are working on becoming the engine for personalized synthetic media - to learn more get in touch at *hello@pollinations.ai*.

###### For the future

The need to design digital worlds is rising fast but the power is still concentrated in the hands of a few people, making experimentation difficult. But we believe **the metaverse should be trippy**, and we want it to be built by diverse minds. Soon on Pollinations you will be able to create **customized 3D objects** at scale and **personalized immersive environments** within minutes.
