    By integrating with Pollinations’ API users can create all of this and much more <b> without switching platforms.</b> We offer <b>presets and looks</b> so that all media created can have the visual identity of your brand.

    Music platforms, NFTs, articles about emerging technology, luxury hotels, 3D object stores and many more are getting a touch of magic with Pollinations’ AI-power. Let us hear about your goals at <span style={{color: 'rgb(233, 250, 41)'}}> hello@pollinations.ai </span>

    Imagine that within Discord or Slack people can write a prompt to a bot and get the exact media they want.
