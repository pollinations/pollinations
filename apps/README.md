## Auto-Deployment

Apps are **auto-deployed to Cloudflare Pages** when merged to `main`.

**Trigger:** Any change in `apps/{app-name}/` → deploys to `https://{app-name}.pollinations.ai`

**What happens:**
1. PWA assets generated (favicon, og-image, manifest)
2. Dependencies installed
3. App built (if `buildCommand` in `apps.json`)
4. Deployed to Cloudflare Pages

## Adding a New App

### 1. Create from template
```bash
cp -r apps/_templates/react apps/my-app
```

### 2. Register in `apps.json`
```json
{
  "my-app": {
    "subdomain": "my-app",
    "buildCommand": "npm run build",
    "outputDir": "dist",
    "title": "My App",
    "description": "What my app does"
  }
}
```

### 3. Push to main
```bash
git add apps/my-app apps/apps.json
git commit -m "Add my-app"
git push
```

Your app will be live at `https://my-app.pollinations.ai`

## Manual Deploy

```bash
# Deploy a single app
./apps/_scripts/deploy.sh gsoc

# Requires CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN and CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID env vars
```

## App Types

| Type | Build | Example |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Pure HTML** | None | catgpt |
| **React + Vite** | `npm run build` | gsoc, chat |

## PWA Assets (Auto-Generated)

Each app gets:
- `favicon.ico`, `favicon-*.png`
- `icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png`
- `apple-touch-icon.png`
- `manifest.json`
- `og-image.png` (1200×630 social preview)

## What Makes a Good App Submission

To increase the chances of approval during app review, submitted apps should meet the following criteria:

### Required
- Clearly and meaningfully use **Pollinations.ai APIs** (text, image, or multimodal)
- Be **open-source** with a public GitHub repository
- Include a **working demo URL** (auto-deployed or external)
- Contain a clear `README.md` inside the app folder explaining:
  - What the app does
  - Which Pollinations models/APIs are used
  - How to run or build the app locally
- Provide real user value (not just a thin API wrapper)

### Strongly Recommended
- Clean and usable UI
- Focused scope (one clear purpose)
- Non-duplicative idea (check existing apps before submitting)

### Common Reasons for Rejection
- No clear Pollinations API usage
- Vague or incomplete app descriptions
- Missing or private repository
- Spam, affiliate links, or misleading “money earning” claims
- Very low-effort generators
- Duplicate submissions of existing apps

Following these guidelines helps maintain a high-quality app ecosystem and speeds up the review process.
