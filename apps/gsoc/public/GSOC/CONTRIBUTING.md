Before you start, please refer to the main [`README.md`](../../../../README.md) file of the `pollinations.ai` repository. It lists all the insights and provides an overview. There are dedicated issues from versatile topics under the repository [Issues](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/issues) section.

- The `Apply Now` button will redirect you to a GitHub issue template where you can fill in your details and submit your application.
- Once we review your application, we will get back to you with further steps.

### 2. After Selecting a Project

- Once your application is reviewed we will rank your application based on various parameters and it will be sent to Google for final review.

- Depending on the Timeline as mentioned in the [GSOC 26' Timeline](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline), you will be notified if you have been accepted for the program.

- If your application is selected we will run through a quick onboarding session with you to help you understand the pollinations codebase and for regulating your understanding with the project mentor.

### 3. Building the project under GSOC 26'

- Once onboarded, you can start working on the project as per the timeline.
- The mentor will help you with the tasks and guide you through the development process.
- We expect nearly  4 hours of engagement per week during the coding period.
- Your work will be evaluated based on the milestones set in the project objectives
- We will wait till the mid-evaluation period to see your progress and provide an intermediate feedback. 
- Feel free to communicate with your mentor for any help or guidance or contact at gsoc@pollinations.ai.

For the time being, you will be onboarded as an external contributor to the repository. With that being set, you shall be working on a specific feature branch created for your project. You can set a tracking issue within the repository to track your progress and link your pull requests to the issue.

## Getting Started


1.  **Create a Branch for Your Work**: Create a new branch for your specific contribution. It's good practice to name your branch related to the issue you're addressing (`gsoc/projectID`).

    ```bash
    git checkout -b `gsoc/projectID`
    ```

2.  **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes, focusing on the MVP for the chosen issue.

3.  **Commit Your Changes**: Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive message.

    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: COMMIT MESSAGE"
    ```

    (Replace "XYZ" with the actual issue number)

4.  **Push Your Changes**: Push your local branch with your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

    ```bash
    git push origin `gsoc/projectID`
    ```


## Guidelines

Follow the Coding Style: Write your code using the same style and rules that the project already uses. This helps keep the code consistent and easy to read for everyone.

Write Clear Commit Messages: When saving your changes (committing), write messages that clearly and simply explain what you did and why.

Document Your Changes Well: Add comments to your code where needed to explain how it works. If you are updating or adding documentation, make sure it is clear and accurate.

Test Your Work: If you can, write and run tests to check that your changes work correctly and do not break anything else.
