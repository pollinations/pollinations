# Project Ideas GSOC 26'

## 1. Pollinations Gaming SDKs (Roblox/Godot/Unity)

**ID:** 0xprj01  
**Category:** Game Dev  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**Duration:** 175 hours  
**Mentor:** 0xmnt01

**Description:** Create plug-and-play SDKs to bring generative AI into popular game engines.

**Long Description:**  
The 'Roblox for AI' vision needs concrete tools. This project involves building and documenting easy-to-use SDKs or 'starter kits' for Roblox, Godot, or Unity. The goal is to allow a 'vibe coder' (a teenager with no credit card) to add generative AI NPCs, textures, or dialogue to their game in one line of code.

**Technologies:** Lua, C#, GDScript, Rest API

## 2. 'Pollen' Economy Dashboard & Wallet

**ID:** 0xprj02  
**Category:** Web Development  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**Duration:** 175 hours  
**Mentor:** 0xmnt02

**Description:** A visual dashboard for the Pollen credit system and creator earnings.

**Long Description:**  
Pollinations is building a circular economy where developers earn 'Pollen' credits when people use their apps. This project involves building the user-facing 'Wallet' and 'Dashboard' that visualizes earnings, usage stats, and the flow of value. It should be gamified, 'crunchy', and satisfying to use.

**Technologies:** React, TypeScript, Recharts/D3, Web3 (Concepts)

## 3. Mycelial Network Visualizer

**ID:** 0xprj03  
**Category:** Data Visualization  
**Difficulty:** Advanced  
**Duration:** 350 hours  
**Mentor:** 0xmnt01

**Description:** Interactive 3D visualization of the Pollinations app ecosystem.

**Long Description:**  
Our vision is a 'mycelial network' of millions of micro-apps. This project creates a stunning, interactive 3D visualization of this network. Nodes represent apps/models, edges represent API calls/value flow. It will serve as the centerpiece of our homepage to show the scale and liveness of the ecosystem.

**Technologies:** Three.js, React Three Fiber, Graph Theory

## 4. AI Content Safety & Moderation Suite

**ID:** 0xprj04  
**Category:** AI/ML  
**Difficulty:** Advanced  
**Duration:** 350 hours  
**Mentor:** 0xmnt02

**Description:** Community-driven safety tools for gaming-friendly AI.

**Long Description:**  
To support our 'Roblox for AI' strategy, safety is paramount. This project involves researching and implementing lightweight, low-latency content safety filters that can sit between the pollinations.ai API and game clients. It ensures generated text/images are appropriate for younger audiences.

**Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, FastAPI

## 5. Interactive 'Vibe Coding' Playground

**ID:** 0xprj05  
**Category:** Web Development  
**Difficulty:** Advanced  
**Duration:** 350 hours  
**Mentor:** 0xmnt01

**Description:** A web-based IDE for generating mini-apps from natural language.

**Long Description:**  
Lower the barrier to entry even further. Build a web-based playground where users can type natural language instructions ('Make a bouncing ball game') and see the code/app generated instantly using Pollinations' underlying models. It's about the 'teenage hacker spirit'—instant feedback, zero setup.

**Technologies:** React, Monaco Editor, WebContainers


## 6. Pollinations CLI Tool 
**ID:** 0xprj06
**Category:** Developer Tools
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Duration:** 175 hours
**Mentor:** 0xmnt02

**Description:** A command-line interface for interacting with Pollinations APIs.

**Long Description:**
Full platform management from terminal: polli auth (login/sessions), polli keys (create/revoke API keys), polli apps (register, set tier, domains), polli deploy (deploy to hosting), polli usage (balance, stats), polli test (API tests), polli ai (conversational assistant), polli skills (install/manage tools), polli generate (quick image/text/audio).
Extensions: --ui browser mode, GitHub Action for pollinations ai. 

**Technologies:** Node.js, TypeScript, Commander.js, Pollinations REST API.


## 7. Semantic Stegnography for AI Generated Synthetic Media 
**ID:** 0xprj07
**Category:** AI/ML
**Difficulty:** Advanced
**Duration:** 350 hours
**Mentor:** 0xmnt01

**Description:** Embedding metadata in AI-generated media for provenance and authenticity.
**Long Description:**
Develop techniques to embed semantic metadata (like creator info, generation parameters) into AI-generated images, audio, or video files without affecting perceptual quality. This helps in tracking the origin and authenticity of synthetic media, addressing concerns around deepfakes and misinformation.

**Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Steganography Techniques.
