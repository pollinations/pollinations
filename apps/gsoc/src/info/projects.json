    "longDescription": "The 'Roblox for AI' vision needs concrete tools. This project involves building and documenting easy-to-use SDKs or 'starter kits' for Roblox, Godot, or Unity. The goal is to allow a 'vibe coder' (a teenager with no credit card) to add generative AI NPCs, textures, or dialogue to their game in one line of code.",

This project involves building the user-facing 'Wallet' and 'Dashboard' that visualizes earnings, usage stats, and the flow of value. It should be gamified, 'crunchy', and satisfying to use.",
