*Creative infrastructure for the next generation of developers.*

## **1. What Myceli Is**

Myceli AI is the company behind **pollinations.ai**, a developer-first AI platform built around a unified credit system called **Pollen**.
Myceli builds and maintains the underlying infrastructure, ecosystem, and economic model that power pollinations.ai and any future products in our creative AI portfolio.

Our mission is to enable developers to build AI-native apps with **ease**, **beauty**, and **economic sustainability**.
Our role is to maintain the ecosystem in which these apps thrive.

## **2. What pollinations.ai Is**

pollinations.ai is Myceli’s flagship product — an AI platform designed for creative developers.

pollinations.ai offers:

* A **unified API** for generative media (image, text, audio; real-time + video in development)
* **Pollen**, a single credit usable across all models
* Developer tiers and rewards
* pollinations.ai Login (OAuth) for user identity and Pollen spending
* A community building tools, games, and creative experiences every day

pollinations.ai shifts AI from a set of isolated tools into a **coherent, shared ecosystem**.

## **3. The Business Model: The Pollen Economy**

The core of the business is **Pollen purchased by end-users inside apps built by developers**.

### How it works:

1. Developers build apps using pollinations.ai and integrate pollinations.ai Login
2. Users sign in with one click
3. Users **buy Pollen directly inside those apps**
4. Developers receive rewards (flexible model)
5. Apps grow, new apps appear, Pollen demand rises
6. The ecosystem expands on its own

This is a **network-effect economy**, not a SaaS product.

* Developers get an economic incentive
* Users get a single currency for AI
* pollinations.ai becomes the identity, wallet, and infrastructure layer connecting everything

APIs, tiers, and direct developer purchases exist — but they are **secondary**.
The primary engine is **in-app Pollen purchases** across a growing network of developer-built experiences.

## **4. Developer Ecosystem & Tiers**

Developers can **earn Pollen daily** to build their ideas:

* **Spore** — entry-level, free Pollen to explore
* **Seed** — verified developer, more daily Pollen
* **Flower** — working app, higher grants
* **Nectar** — app with traction, highest grants

Upcoming:
**Quests & one-off rewards** to encourage contributions, creativity, and ecosystem growth.

This structure fosters early experimentation and long-term retention.

## **5. The Flywheel**

**Builders → Users → Pollen Purchases → Rewards → More Builders → More Apps → More Users**

1. Developers join
2. They build apps using pollinations.ai
3. Users log in using pollinations.ai Login
4. Users buy Pollen inside those apps
5. Developers earn rewards → reinvest into their apps
6. The ecosystem grows with each new app

The result:
A self-sustaining, expanding creative economy.

## **7. Why Myceli / pollinations.ai Will Win**

* **Unified currency (Pollen)** across many apps — simple, human, and scalable
* **Network-effect ecosystem**: more apps → more users → more Pollen spent
* **Aesthetic, warm brand** rare in developer infrastructure
* **Open-source roots and community-first DNA**
* **Ideal for young developers, creators, and indie teams**, while still attractive to studios
* **Long-term moat:** identity + wallet + economy + API + hosting + discovery

pollinations.ai is not just an API.
It’s an **AI-native app economy built on a shared credit system**.
Myceli is the company growing that economy.
