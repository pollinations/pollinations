# 💰 Business Model

Myceli operates the *pollinations.ai* ecosystem, and the core of our business is the **Pollen economy**: a universal credit that users purchase and spend across applications built with *pollinations.ai*.

## Overview

*pollinations.ai* provides:
- A unified multimodal API (image, text, audio; video and real-time coming)
- *pollinations.ai* Login (OAuth) for identity, wallet, and Pollen usage
- A simple, transparent credit system (Pollen)
- Developer tiers, grants, and ecosystem rewards

## Core Revenue Engine: In-App Pollen Purchases

Developers build apps with *pollinations.ai* → users sign in with *pollinations.ai* → users buy Pollen directly inside those apps.

This creates a flywheel:
1. Developers build apps
2. Users log in through *pollinations.ai*
3. Users purchase Pollen inside those apps
4. Developers earn rewards (structure flexible)
5. Apps grow → new developers join
6. Pollen demand increases across the ecosystem

Revenue is driven primarily by end-user Pollen purchases, not API subscriptions.

## Secondary Revenue Streams

- Direct Pollen purchases by developers or teams
- API usage from professional or enterprise clients
- Optional future premium tools (hosting, analytics, discovery)

These strengthen the ecosystem but do not define it.

## Why This Works

By standardizing identity (Login), spending (Pollen), and infrastructure (API, hosting, SDKs), *pollinations.ai* becomes the shared layer beneath a growing landscape of AI-native apps. Each new app increases Pollen circulation, expands the network, and reinforces Myceli's long-term position.
