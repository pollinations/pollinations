# 📃 Executive Summary

**Myceli AI** is the company behind **pollinations.ai**, a creative AI platform built around **Pollen**, a universal credit that powers generative media across apps.
Where pollinations.ai is the product developers use, Myceli is the entity that builds the **infrastructure, strategy, and economy** powering it.

**pollinations.ai** gives developers a unified way to build AI-native apps:

* One multimodal API (image, text, audio; real-time + video coming)
* **Pollen**, a single credit for all models
* pollinations.ai Login (OAuth) for identity, wallet, and spending
* Developer tiers and rewards that support early experimentation

### **Business Model**

The core of Myceli’s business is the **Pollen economy**.
Developers build apps using pollinations.ai → end-users log in with pollinations.ai → users buy Pollen inside those apps → developers earn rewards → apps grow → Pollen demand increases.

APIs and direct developer purchases support the ecosystem, but the **primary revenue engine** is **end-user Pollen purchases inside developer-built apps**.

### **The Flywheel**

More developers → more apps → more users → more Pollen spent → more rewards → more developers.
A network-effect ecosystem where identity, currency, and infrastructure flow through pollinations.ai.

### **Roadmap (Highlights)**

* Secure front-end Pollen spending
* In-app Pollen purchases (core economic unlock)
* Real-time models + video generation
* App hosting & discovery
* Quests, bounties, ecosystem incentives
* Embedded widgets & SDK upgrades

### **Why Myceli Wins**

* A unified credit powering many apps
* Strong community + open-source values
* A brand and developer experience that resonates with creative builders
* A scalable economic engine instead of a traditional SaaS model

Myceli is building the infrastructure and economy powering the next generation of AI-native apps — with pollinations.ai as the entry point.
