# 🗺️ Roadmap

*Timelines are indicative and may evolve as we ship, learn, and scale.*

---

#### Q4 2025 — Beta & Foundations

Focus: ship a solid core so developers can build confidently and we can observe real usage.

- Pollen packs and wallet foundations  
- Developer tiers (Spore, Seed, Flower, Nectar) wired into daily grant logic  
- pollinations.ai Login (OAuth) beta across key surfaces  
- Dev console for API keys, Pollen balance, and basic usage stats  
- Telemetry MVP for Pollen events and app-level activity  
- Abuse controls: basic rate limits, spend caps, and anomaly detection  

---

#### Q1 2026 — In-App Economy Foundations

Focus: make Pollen a real in-app currency and give developers visibility.

- pollinations.ai Login GA (stable, documented, and recommended path)  
- Secure front-end Pollen spending (safe client-side usage)  
- In-app Pollen payments fully enabled for partner apps  
- First in-app Pollen purchase flows (checkout + top-up UX)  
- Unified model catalog with clear Pollen pricing per modality  
- Developer analytics dashboard (apps, users, Pollen flows, conversions)  
- Incremental model expansion: real-time audio and improved text/image routing
- Quests, bounties, and one-off rewards for developers and contributors  

---

#### Q2 2026 — Ecosystem Monetization & Tools

Focus: help apps earn and deepen user engagement inside the Pollen economy.

- Widget for apps (login, balance, and 1-click top-up)  
- Early developer earnings in Pollen (rev-share framework, flexible structure)  
- Integrated deploy flow from the dev console (code → live app)  
- Optional ads plugin (brand-safe, consent-based; Pollen rewards for views)  
- SDK upgrades and templates for faster app creation (web, mobile, bots)  
- App profiles tied to pollinations.ai Login and Pollen usage  
- Early discovery surface for top apps (internal rankings, curated lists)  
- More granular analytics for high-performing apps (funnels, retention, monetization)
- Hosting available to a broader set of developers as infrastructure stabilizes  

---

#### H2 2026 — Mature Monetization & Infrastructure Optimization

Focus: make pollinations.ai the easiest place to build, host, and grow an AI-native app, with a complete Pollen economy.

- Developer cash-out / fiat revenue share (subject to compliance and risk review)  
- Clear economic dashboards for developers (earnings, Pollen flows, user cohorts)  
- Refinements to rev-share mechanics based on live data  
- Expanded model catalog (video, advanced multimodal, agents)  
- Optimization of infra costs and Pollen pricing based on real-world usage
