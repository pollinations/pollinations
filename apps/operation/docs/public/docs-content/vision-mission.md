# 🔭 Vision & Mission

## Vision

At Myceli AI, we imagine a future where AI is not locked behind corporate walls, but woven into a vibrant ecosystem of apps created by thousands of developers. We believe the next generation of software will be AI-native, multimodal, and powered by shared economies—not a patchwork of isolated subscriptions.

Our vision is to build the economic and infrastructural layer that makes this possible.

Pollinations.ai is the first expression of that vision: a warm, expressive developer platform where anyone can build AI experiences without friction. Pollen, our universal credit, becomes the shared currency those experiences rely on.

In this future, developers create the experiences.  
Users bring the imagination.  
Pollen connects everything.

## Mission

Our mission is to empower creative developers to build the next generation of AI-native applications by providing a unified platform, a shared identity layer, and a simple economic system powered by Pollen.

We make it easy for developers to:
- Build multimodal AI apps without complex infra
- Let users sign in with Pollinations Login
- Enable in-app Pollen purchases instantly
- Earn rewards as their apps gain traction
- Grow inside a supportive and open community

We want to make AI feel alive, accessible, and playful—while giving developers real economic opportunities. The result is an ecosystem where every new app strengthens the whole network.
