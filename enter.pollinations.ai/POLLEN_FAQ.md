# FAQ

## 💎 What is Pollen?

Pollen is our prepaid credit system. **$1 ≈ 1 Pollen** *(pricing may evolve)*. You spend it to make API calls — every generation costs Pollen based on the model you use.

## 🧩 Is Pollinations a coding tool or app builder?

No. Pollinations is **not** a code editor, no-code builder, or app development platform like Lovable, Bolt, or Cursor. We provide the **building blocks** that creators integrate into their own apps:

- **AI Generation APIs** — Access 38+ models (text, image, audio, video) through a single API.
- **Payment Infrastructure** — Let your app's users pay per use with Pollen credits, so you don't foot the compute bill.
- **Monetization Tools** — Revenue share (launching Q2), and soon ads SDK — everything you need to earn from your app.

You build the app your way — with any framework, any tool, any language. Then you plug in Pollinations for the AI capabilities and the monetization. We're the engine and the cash register, not the workshop.

## 🛒 How do I get Pollen?

There are three ways:

1.  **Buy It:** Purchase Pollen packs directly with a credit card. This Pollen goes into your wallet and *never expires*. *(Want other payment options? [Vote here](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/issues/4826)!)*
2.  **Grants:** Registered users get 1.5 free Pollen per week. Creator tiers get daily grants that scale with your level.
3.  **Earn It:** Contribute to the ecosystem — code, docs, community support, publishing apps — and your score goes up, unlocking higher tiers with bigger daily grants.

## 🆓 Can I try it for free?

Yes. Register, grab an API key, and start building. Every account gets 1.5 free Pollen per week right away — no credit card required. As you contribute and grow your score, you unlock creator tiers with daily grants (up to 20 pollen/day at Nectar).

## 💳 What payment methods do you accept?

Currently, we accept *credit cards*. We're actively exploring other payment methods based on community feedback.

## 🎉 What do I get when I register?

Registration gives you access to the Pollinations API. You can create API keys to start making requests right away:

- **🌐 Publishable Key (pk\_):** Designed for client-side apps *(bound to your domain)*. Rate limits: 1 pollen per IP per hour. Access to all models, which consume Pollen based on usage.
- **🔒 Secret Key (sk\_):** For server-side apps only. *No rate limits.* Access to all models, which consume Pollen based on usage.

All registered accounts get **1.5 free Pollen per week** — no purchase required. As a creator, your score determines your creator tier — earn 8+ points to unlock Seed and start receiving daily grants.

## 🏅 What are tiers?

There are two kinds of tiers on Pollinations:

**Free weekly grant — for everyone on the platform:**

Every registered user gets **1.5 free Pollen per week**, refreshed every Monday. Use it across any app — no creator tier required.

**Creator tiers — for builders and contributors:**

| Tier | Points | Daily Pollen |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 🌿 Seed | 8+ | 3 pollen/day |
| 🌸 Flower | 20+ | 10 pollen/day |
| 🍯 Nectar | 50+ | 20 pollen/day |

Creator tiers are earned through your score. The more you build, contribute, and grow, the bigger your daily grants. For details on how scores are calculated, see [How Tier Scoring Works →](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/blob/main/TIER_SCORING.md).

## 📊 How is my score calculated?

Your score reflects your overall contribution to the Pollinations ecosystem. It factors in things like:

- Publishing and maintaining apps
- Driving API usage and growing your audience
- Contributing code, docs, or bug reports
- Community participation (Discord, GitHub)
- Integrating BYOP in your apps

Scores update daily. The exact formula may evolve as we learn what works best. For the full breakdown, see [How Tier Scoring Works →](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/blob/main/TIER_SCORING.md).

If you think your score is wrong, you can [appeal your tier →](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/issues/new?template=tier-appeal.yml).

## 🔌 What is BYOP (Bring Your Own Pollen)?

BYOP lets your app's users pay for their own AI generations with their Pollen — instead of it coming out of your balance.

**Why it matters:** Without BYOP, every user of your app burns *your* Pollen. With BYOP, your compute cost drops to zero. Your users get a seamless experience, and you can scale without worrying about costs.

Every user on the platform gets 1.5 free Pollen per week. With BYOP, they spend that Pollen in *your* app. BYOP is the key to the Pollinations flywheel: build an app for free → integrate BYOP → your users arrive with Pollen → they fuel the app → your score grows → bigger daily grants → build bigger.

## 🌱 How do Pollen grants work?

**Registered users:** 1.5 Pollen per week, refreshed weekly.

**Seed / Flower / Nectar (creator tiers):** Daily Pollen grants that scale with your tier. Unused daily Pollen expires each day.

In both cases, grant Pollen is spent *before* your purchased Pollen. Purchased Pollen never expires.

💚 **Thanks to our supporters**, all registered users receive free Pollen during beta.

## ⚡ How is my Pollen spent?

Your daily tier Pollen is always used *first*, then your purchased Pollen:

1. **Free grants** — Used first for most models
2. **Purchased Pollen** — Used after daily is depleted

**Exception:** Some premium models are marked with a 💎 **Paid Only** badge. These require purchased Pollen and *cannot* use daily tier grants. This ensures sustainable access to high-cost models while keeping daily Pollen available for experimentation.

## 🎨 What can I create with Pollen?

Think of Pollen like buying in bulk — *the more efficient the model, the more you get!*

**Pro tip:** Mix efficient models for high-volume tasks with premium models when quality matters most.

## 👛 How does my Pollen wallet work?

You get *one central Pollen wallet* for all your applications. Top it up anytime and use it across the entire Pollinations ecosystem.
