# FAQ

## What is Pollen?

Pollen is our prepaid credit system. **$1 ≈ 1 Pollen** (pricing may evolve). You spend it to make API calls to premium models. Free models always cost 0 Pollen.

## How do I get Pollen?

There are three ways to add Pollen to your balance:
1.  **Buy It:** Purchase Pollen packs directly with a credit card. This Pollen goes into your wallet and never expires.
2.  **Get a Daily Sponsorship:** If you are in a Sponsorship Tier (Seed, Flower, or Nectar), you receive a free Pollen allowance added to your account every day.
3.  **Earn It:** Complete one-time community rewards, like starring our GitHub repo or helping solve a technical issue.

## What payment methods do you accept?

Currently, we accept credit cards. We are looking into other options for users in countries with payment restrictions.

## Is there a monthly subscription?

Not yet, but we're considering it based on community feedback. Check out the [voting issue](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/issues/2202) to share your thoughts or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pollinations) for updates.

## Can I try it without signing up?

Yep! You can use our API with **Anonymous access** — no signup, account, or payment needed. You can call all free models, subject to standard rate limits.

## What changes when I register?

Registering itself gives you an account. The real power is unlocked when you **create and use an API key**. Registering is the necessary first step to do that.

- **Using a Front-End Key:** If you use this key in your client-side app, you get the **better rate limits**.
- **Using a Server-to-Server Key:** This key gives you the best rate limits for free models. It also gives you **access to all models and to spend Pollen**.

If you register but do not use a key, your rate limits will be the same as an anonymous user.

**Note:** Currently, only Server-to-Server Keys can spend Pollen. We're working on secure front-end spending to enable this for Front-End Keys as well, and hope to have this ready for launch.

## How do daily Pollen grants work?

Daily Pollen grants are a benefit for users in a **Sponsorship Tier**.
- We have three tiers: **Seed**, **Flower**, and **Nectar**. The only difference is that higher tiers get more daily Pollen.
- **Before our official launch (early December):** Registering automatically places you in the **Seed** tier.
- **After our official launch:** New users are not automatically assigned to a sponsorship tier, but can request to join one from their dashboard.

This daily sponsored Pollen is always spent before your purchased Pollen balance.

## How much Pollen do models use?

Each model uses different amounts of Pollen based on what it costs us to run. Here's what you can generate per Pollen (remember: **1 Pollen = $1**):

**Image Models:**
- **flux**: ∞ images per Pollen (always free!)
- **turbo**: ~333 images per Pollen
- **kontext**: ~200 images per Pollen
- **gptimage**: ~77 images per Pollen
- **nanobanana**: ~50 images per Pollen

**Text Models:**
- **Basic responses**: 100,000+ per Pollen
- **Premium responses**: ~1,000 per Pollen

## What can I create with 10 Pollen?

With just 10 Pollen (≈$10), you can generate:
- **500 nanobanana images** — premium quality AI art that's perfect for professional projects
- **3,300 turbo images** — rapid prototyping and quick iterations
- **2,000 kontext images** — balanced quality for most use cases
- **770 gptimage images** — GPT-powered visual generation
- **100,000+ basic text responses** — chatbot conversations, content generation
- **10,000 premium text responses** — advanced reasoning and analysis
- **Unlimited flux images** — completely free, always!

## Will free models always be free?

Yes! Free models remain free forever for all users. We're committed to keeping AI accessible.

## How does my Pollen wallet work?

You get one central Pollen wallet for all your applications. Top it up anytime and use it across the entire Pollinations ecosystem.

## What's coming?

- **Secure front-end spending:** We are building a solution to allow client-side apps to spend Pollen securely, which will power features like in-app purchases.
- **In-app purchases** — let your users buy Pollen in your app, you get a bonus.
- **Ads plugin** — earn Pollen when users see ads.
- **More models:** Expect video, real-time audio, and an ever-expanding catalog.
- **Quests:** Earn Pollen by completing community bounties and contributing to projects.
