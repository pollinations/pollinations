# FAQ

## What is Pollen?

Pollen is our prepaid credit system. **$1 ≈ 1 Pollen** (pricing may evolve). You spend it to make API calls to paid models. Free models always cost 0 Pollen.

## How do I get Pollen?

There are three ways to add Pollen to your balance:
1.  **Buy It:** Purchase Pollen packs directly with a credit card. This Pollen goes into your wallet and never expires. (Want other payment options? [Vote here](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/issues/4826)!)
2.  **Get Daily Pollen:** During and after beta, registered developers receive daily Pollen grants to support experimentation based on their tier *(seed, flower, or nectar)*.
3.  **Earn It:** Complete one-time community rewards, like starring our GitHub repo or helping solve a technical issue.

## What payment methods do you accept?

Currently, we accept credit cards. We're actively exploring other payment methods based on community feedback.

## Is there a monthly subscription?

Not yet, but we're considering it based on community feedback. Check out the [voting issue](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/issues/2202) to share your thoughts or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pollinations) for updates.

## Can I try it without signing up?

Yep! You can use our API with **Anonymous access** — no signup, account, or payment needed. You can call all free models, subject to standard rate limits.

## What changes when I register?

Registering itself gives you an account. The real power is unlocked when you **create and use an API key**. Registering is the necessary first step to do that.

- **Using a Front-End Key:** Designed for client-side apps (bound to your domain). Medium rate limits. Access to all models — free models cost 0 Pollen, paid models spend Pollen.
- **Using a Server-to-Server Key:** For backend apps. No platform rate limits. Access to all models — free models cost 0 Pollen, paid models spend Pollen.

If you register but do not use a key, your rate limits will be the same as an anonymous user.

## How do daily Pollen grants work?

Registered developers receive daily Pollen grants to support experimentation based on their tier. 
Pollen grants are always spent before your purchased Pollen balance, and it expires each day.

## How much Pollen do models use?

Each model costs different amounts of Pollen based on what it costs us to run (**$1 ≈ 1 Pollen**). Here are some real examples:

**Image Generation:**
- **Flux** — ~8,300 images per Pollen (ultra-efficient!)
- **Turbo** — ~3,300 images per Pollen
- **GPTImage** — ~125 images per Pollen (vision-capable, higher quality)
- **Seedream** — ~33 images per Pollen (premium quality)
- **Kontext** — 25 images per Pollen (advanced editing)

**Text Generation** *(typical conversation ~600 tokens)*:
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash** — ~3,800 conversations per Pollen
- **Mistral Small** — ~5,900 conversations per Pollen
- **GPT-5 Nano** — ~5,300 conversations per Pollen (vision-capable!)
- **DeepSeek V3.1** — ~445 conversations per Pollen (advanced reasoning)
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5** — ~150 conversations per Pollen (top-tier quality)

*Prices are approximate and based on typical usage. For exact token-based pricing, check the pricing table on your dashboard.*

## What can I create with 1 Pollen?

**With just 1 Pollen, you could:**
- Generate **8,000+ images** with Flux (perfect for bulk generation)
- Have **5,000+ conversations** with efficient text models like Mistral or Gemini
- Create **125 high-quality images** with GPTImage (vision + editing capabilities)
- Process **445 advanced reasoning tasks** with DeepSeek
- Run **150 conversations** with Claude Sonnet (premium quality responses)

**With 10 Pollen ($10):**
- **83,000 Flux images** — enough for a large-scale app or service
- **59,000 Mistral conversations** — power a chatbot for months
- **1,250 GPTImage creations** — professional image generation with editing
- **4,450 DeepSeek reasoning sessions** — complex problem solving
- **1,500 Claude Sonnet chats** — top-tier AI conversations

Mix and match models based on your needs. Use efficient models for high-volume tasks and premium models when quality matters most!
