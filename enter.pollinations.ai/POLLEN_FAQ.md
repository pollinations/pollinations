# FAQ

## What is Pollen?

Pollen is our prepaid credit system. **$1 ≈ 1 Pollen** (pricing may evolve). You spend it to make API calls.

## How do I get Pollen?

There are three ways to add Pollen to your balance:

1.  **Buy It:** Purchase Pollen packs directly with a credit card. This Pollen goes into your wallet and never expires. (Want other payment options? [Vote here](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/issues/4826)!)
2.  **Get Daily Pollen:** During and after beta, registered developers receive daily Pollen grants to support experimentation based on their tier _(spore, seed, flower, or nectar)_.
3.  **Earn It:** Complete one-time community rewards, like helping solve a technical issue or contributing to the project.

## What payment methods do you accept?

Currently, we accept credit cards. We're actively exploring other payment methods based on community feedback.

## Is there a monthly subscription?

Not yet, but we're considering it based on community feedback. Check out the [voting issue](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/issues/2202) to share your thoughts or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pollinations-ai-885844321461485618) for updates.

## Can I try it without signing up?

Not currently. You need to register and use an API key to access our models. All API calls require authentication and consume Pollen based on the model you use.

## What do I get when I register?

Registration gives you access to the Pollinations API and the **Spore tier**, which includes daily Pollen\* to get you started. Once registered, you can **create API keys** to start making requests.

\*During beta only - subject to change

- **Publishable Key (pk\_):** Designed for client-side apps (bound to your domain). Rate limits: 1 pollen/hour per IP+key. Access to all models, which consume Pollen based on usage.
- **Secret Key (sk\_):** For server-side apps only. No rate limits. Access to all models, which consume Pollen based on usage.

## How do daily Pollen grants work?

You receive a daily Pollen grant based on your tier. Daily Pollen is spent before your purchased Pollen. Unused Pollen expires each day.

💚 **Thanks to our supporters**, all tiers receive free daily Pollen during beta.

## What can I create with Pollen?

Think of Pollen like buying in bulk — the more efficient the model, the more you get! (**$1 ≈ 1 Pollen**)

**🎨 Image Generation:**

- **Flux** — 8,300 images per Pollen (ultra-efficient for bulk!)
- **Turbo** — 3,300 images per Pollen (fast generation)
- **GPTImage** — 125 images per Pollen (vision-capable, higher quality)
- **Seedream** — 33 images per Pollen (premium quality)
- **Kontext** — 25 images per Pollen (advanced editing)

**💬 Text Generation** _(~600 token conversations)_:

- **Mistral Small** — 5,900 conversations per Pollen (super efficient)
- **GPT-5 Nano** — 5,300 conversations per Pollen (vision-capable!)
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash** — 3,800 conversations per Pollen (fast & smart)
- **DeepSeek V3.1** — 445 conversations per Pollen (advanced reasoning)
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5** — 150 conversations per Pollen (top-tier quality)

**💡 Real-World Examples:**

- **1 Pollen** = 8,000+ Flux images OR 5,900 Mistral chats
- **10 Pollen ($10)** = 83,000 Flux images OR 59,000 Mistral chats — enough to power an app for months!

**Pro tip:** Mix efficient models for high-volume tasks with premium models when quality matters most.
