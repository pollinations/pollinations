# FAQ

## What is Pollen?

Pollen is our prepaid credit system. **$1 ≈ 1 Pollen** (pricing may evolve). You spend it to make API calls to paid models. Free models always cost 0 Pollen.

## How do I get Pollen?

There are three ways to add Pollen to your balance:
1.  **Buy It:** Purchase Pollen packs directly with a credit card. This Pollen goes into your wallet and never expires.
2.  **Get Daily Pollen:** During and after beta, registered developers receive daily Pollen grants to support experimentation based on their tier *(seed, flower, or nectar)*.
3.  **Earn It:** Complete one-time community rewards, like starring our GitHub repo or helping solve a technical issue.

## What payment methods do you accept?

Currently, we accept credit cards. We are looking into other options for users in countries with payment restrictions.

## Is there a monthly subscription?

Not yet, but we're considering it based on community feedback. Check out the [voting issue](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/issues/2202) to share your thoughts or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pollinations) for updates.

## Can I try it without signing up?

Yep! You can use our API with **Anonymous access** — no signup, account, or payment needed. You can call all free models, subject to standard rate limits.

## What changes when I register?

Registering itself gives you an account. The real power is unlocked when you **create and use an API key**. Registering is the necessary first step to do that.

- **Using a Front-End Key:** Designed for client-side apps (bound to your domain). Medium rate limits. Access to all models — free models cost 0 Pollen, paid models spend Pollen.
- **Using a Server-to-Server Key:** For backend apps. No platform rate limits. Access to all models — free models cost 0 Pollen, paid models spend Pollen.

If you register but do not use a key, your rate limits will be the same as an anonymous user.

## How do daily Pollen grants work?

Registered developers receive daily Pollen grants to support experimentation based on their tier. 
Pollen grants are always spent before your purchased Pollen balance, and it expires each day.

## How much Pollen do models use?

Each model uses different amounts of Pollen based on what it costs us to run. Here's what you can generate per Pollen (remember: **1 Pollen = $1**):

**Image Models:**
- **flux**: ∞ images per Pollen (always free!)
- **turbo**: ~333 images per Pollen
- **kontext**: ~200 images per Pollen
- **gptimage**: ~77 images per Pollen
- **nanobanana**: ~50 images per Pollen

**Text Models:**
- **Fast models**: 100,000+ responses per Pollen
- **Advanced models**: ~1,000 responses per Pollen

## What can I create with 10 Pollen?

With just 10 Pollen (≈$10), you can generate:
- **500 nanobanana images** — high-quality AI art perfect for professional projects
- **3,300 turbo images** — rapid prototyping and quick iterations
- **2,000 kontext images** — balanced quality for most use cases
- **770 gptimage images** — GPT-powered visual generation
- **100,000+ fast text responses** — chatbot conversations, content generation
- **10,000 advanced text responses** — complex reasoning and analysis
- **Unlimited flux images** — completely free, always!

## How does my Pollen wallet work?

You get one central Pollen wallet for all your applications. Top it up anytime and use it across the entire Pollinations ecosystem.

## What's coming?

- **Secure front-end spending:** We are building a solution to allow client-side apps to spend Pollen securely, which will power features like in-app purchases.
- **In-app purchases** — let your users buy Pollen in your app, you get a bonus.
- **Ads plugin** — earn Pollen when users see ads.
- **More models:** Expect video, real-time audio, and an ever-expanding catalog.
- **Quests:** Earn Pollen by completing community bounties and contributing to projects.
