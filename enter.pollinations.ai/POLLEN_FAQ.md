# FAQ

## 💎 What is Pollen?

Pollen is our prepaid credit system. **$1 ≈ 1 Pollen** *(pricing may evolve)*. You spend it to make API calls.

## 🛒 How do I get Pollen?

There are three ways to add Pollen to your balance:

1.  **Buy It:** Purchase Pollen packs directly with a credit card. This Pollen goes into your wallet and *never expires*. *(Want other payment options? [Vote here](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/issues/4826)!)*
2.  **Get Daily Pollen:** During and after beta, registered developers receive daily Pollen grants to support experimentation based on their tier *(microbe, spore, seed, flower, or nectar)*.
3.  **Earn It:** Complete one-time community rewards, like helping solve a technical issue or contributing to the project.

## 💳 What payment methods do you accept?

Currently, we accept *credit cards*. We're actively exploring other payment methods based on community feedback.

## 🔑 Can I try it without signing up?

Not currently. You need to register and use an API key to access our models. *All API calls require authentication* and consume Pollen based on the model you use.

## 🎉 What do I get when I register?

Registration gives you access to the Pollinations API and the **Spore tier**, which includes *daily Pollen* to get you started. Once registered, you can **create API keys** to start making requests.

- **🌐 Publishable Key (pk\_):** Designed for client-side apps *(bound to your domain)*. Rate limits: 1 pollen per IP per hour. Access to all models, which consume Pollen based on usage.
- **🔒 Secret Key (sk\_):** For server-side apps only. *No rate limits.* Access to all models, which consume Pollen based on usage.

## 🌱 How do daily Pollen grants work?

You receive a daily Pollen grant based on your tier. Daily Pollen is spent *before* your purchased Pollen. Unused Pollen expires each day.

💚 **Thanks to our supporters**, all tiers receive free daily Pollen during beta.

## 🎨 What can I create with Pollen?

Think of Pollen like buying in bulk — *the more efficient the model, the more you get!*

**Pro tip:** Mix efficient models for high-volume tasks with premium models when quality matters most.

## ⚡ How is my pollen spent?

Your daily tier pollen is always used *first*, then your purchased pollen:

1. **Daily grants** — Used first for most models
2. **Purchased pollen** — Used after daily is depleted

**Exception:** Some premium models are marked with a 💎 **Paid Only** badge. These require purchased pollen and *cannot* use daily tier grants. This ensures sustainable access to high-cost models while keeping daily pollen available for experimentation.

## 👛 How does my Pollen wallet work?

You get *one central Pollen wallet* for all your applications. Top it up anytime and use it across the entire Pollinations ecosystem.

## 🚀 What's coming?

- **🔐 Secure front-end spending:** We are building a solution to allow client-side apps to spend Pollen securely, which will power features like in-app purchases.
- **💰 In-app purchases** — let your users buy Pollen in your app, *you get a bonus*.
- **📺 Ads plugin** — earn Pollen when users see ads.
- **🎬 More models:** Expect video, real-time audio, and an ever-expanding catalog.
- **🏆 Quests:** Earn Pollen by completing community bounties and contributing to projects.
