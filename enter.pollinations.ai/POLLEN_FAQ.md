# FAQ

## What is Pollen?

Pollen is our prepaid credit system. **$1 ≈ 1 Pollen** (pricing may evolve). You spend it to make API calls.

## How do I get Pollen?

There are three ways to add Pollen to your balance:

1.  **Buy It:** Purchase Pollen packs directly with a credit card. This Pollen goes into your wallet and never expires. (Want other payment options? [Vote here](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/issues/4826)!)
2.  **Get Daily Pollen:** During and after beta, registered developers receive daily Pollen grants to support experimentation based on their tier _(microbe, spore, seed, flower, or nectar)_.
3.  **Earn It:** Complete one-time community rewards, like helping solve a technical issue or contributing to the project.

## What payment methods do you accept?

Currently, we accept credit cards. We're actively exploring other payment methods based on community feedback.

## Can I try it without signing up?

Not currently. You need to register and use an API key to access our models. All API calls require authentication and consume Pollen based on the model you use.

## What do I get when I register?

Registration gives you access to the Pollinations API and the **Spore tier**, which includes daily Pollen\* to get you started. Once registered, you can **create API keys** to start making requests.

\*During beta only - subject to change

- **Publishable Key (pk\_):** Designed for client-side apps (bound to your domain). Rate limits: 1 pollen per IP per hour. Access to all models, which consume Pollen based on usage.
- **Secret Key (sk\_):** For server-side apps only. No rate limits. Access to all models, which consume Pollen based on usage.

## How do daily Pollen grants work?

You receive a daily Pollen grant based on your tier. Daily Pollen is spent before your purchased Pollen. Unused Pollen expires each day.

💚 **Thanks to our supporters**, all tiers receive free daily Pollen during beta.

## What can I create with Pollen?

Think of Pollen like buying in bulk — the more efficient the model, the more you get!

**Pro tip:** Mix efficient models for high-volume tasks with premium models when quality matters most.

## How is my pollen spent?

Your daily tier pollen is always used first, then your purchased pollen:

1. **Daily grants** — Used first for most models
2. **Purchased pollen** — Used after daily is depleted

**Exception:** Some premium models are marked with a 💎 **Paid Only** badge. These require purchased pollen and cannot use daily tier grants. This ensures sustainable access to high-cost models while keeping daily pollen available for experimentation.

## How does my Pollen wallet work?

You get one central Pollen wallet for all your applications. Top it up anytime and use it across the entire Pollinations ecosystem.

## What's coming?

- **Secure front-end spending:** We are building a solution to allow client-side apps to spend Pollen securely, which will power features like in-app purchases.
- **In-app purchases** — let your users buy Pollen in your app, you get a bonus.
- **Ads plugin** — earn Pollen when users see ads.
- **More models:** Expect video, real-time audio, and an ever-expanding catalog.
- **Quests:** Earn Pollen by completing community bounties and contributing to projects.
