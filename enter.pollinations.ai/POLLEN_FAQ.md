# FAQ

## What is Pollen?

Pollen is our prepaid credit system. $1 = 1 Pollen (beta). You spend it on API calls. Free models cost 0 Pollen — we just track usage for stats.

## How do I get Pollen?

Two ways:
- **Buy packs** with your credit card — goes straight to your wallet, never expires
- **Redeem sponsorship coupons** — temporary Pollen that gets used first, expires 24h after you claim it

## What payment methods do you accept?

Credit cards for now. We're looking into crypto and other options for people in countries with payment restrictions.

## Is there a monthly subscription?

Not yet, but we're considering it based on community feedback. Check out the [voting issue](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/issues/2202) to share your thoughts or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pollinations) for updates.

## Can I try it without signing up or paying?

Yep! Just hit the API — no signup needed. Free models work instantly, no Pollen required.

## What changes when I register?

You keep the free models (with rate limits) and unlock paid models (no rate limits, just costs Pollen). Plus you get daily free Pollen grants.

## How do daily grants work?

Registered users get free Pollen daily. It's spent before your purchased balance.

We have three tiers: **Seed** (default), **Flower**, and **Nectar**. Higher tiers get more daily Pollen. You can request an upgrade in your dashboard.

## How much Pollen do models use?

Each model uses different amounts of Pollen based on what it costs us to run. Free models always cost 0 Pollen.

**Image models** (typical cost per image):
- **flux**: Free forever
- **turbo**: ~0.003 Pollen ($0.003)
- **kontext**: ~0.005 Pollen ($0.005) 
- **nanobanana**: ~0.02 Pollen ($0.02) - *popular for quality*
- **gptimage**: ~0.013 Pollen ($0.013)

**Text models** range from free to ~0.01 Pollen per 1000 tokens, with premium models costing more.

## What can I do with 10 Pollen?

With 10 Pollen ($10), you can generate approximately:
- **3,875 turbo images** (great for quick iterations)
- **1,940 kontext images** (high-quality results)  
- **775 gptimage images** (OpenAI's image model)
- **500 nanobanana images** (premium quality, very popular)
- **100,000+ text responses** with basic models
- **1,000 text responses** with premium models like GPT-5

*These are estimates - actual usage may vary based on image complexity and text length.*

## Will free models always be free?

Yes! Free models remain free forever for all users. We're committed to keeping AI accessible. Paid options only apply to premium models that offer additional capabilities.

## How does my wallet work?

One wallet for all your apps. Top up anytime, use it anywhere.

## What's coming next?

- **In-app purchases** (early 2026) — let your users buy Pollen in your app, you get a bonus
- **More models** — video, real-time audio, expanding the catalog
- **Ads plugin** (2026) — earn Pollen when users see ads
- **Quests** — earn Pollen by starring projects, building cool stuff, etc.
