# FAQ

## What is Pollen?

Pollen is our prepaid credit system. $1 = 1 Pollen (beta). You spend it on API calls. Free models cost 0 Pollen — we just track usage for stats.

## How do I get Pollen?

Two ways:
- **Buy packs** with your credit card — goes straight to your wallet, never expires
- **Redeem sponsorship coupons** — temporary Pollen that gets used first, expires 24h after you claim it

## What payment methods do you accept?

Credit cards for now. We're looking into crypto and other options for people in countries with payment restrictions.

## Is there a monthly subscription?

Not yet, but we're considering it based on community feedback. Check out the [voting issue](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/issues/2202) to share your thoughts or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pollinations) for updates.

## Can I try it without signing up or paying?

Yep! Just hit the API — no signup needed. Free models work instantly, no Pollen required.

## What changes when I register?

You keep the free models (with rate limits) and unlock paid models (no rate limits, just costs Pollen). Plus you get daily free Pollen grants.

## How do daily Pollen grants work?

Every day, registered users get free Pollen automatically. This daily Pollen is spent before your purchased Pollen balance, maximizing your value.

We have three tiers: **Seed** (default), **Flower**, and **Nectar**. Higher tiers get more daily Pollen. You can request an upgrade in your dashboard.

## How much Pollen do models use?

Each model uses different amounts of Pollen based on what it costs us to run. Here's what you can generate per Pollen (remember: **1 Pollen = $1**):

**Image Models:**
- **flux**: ∞ images per Pollen (always free!)
- **turbo**: ~333 images per Pollen (quick iterations)
- **kontext**: ~200 images per Pollen (balanced quality)
- **gptimage**: ~77 images per Pollen (GPT-powered)
- **nanobanana**: ~50 images per Pollen (popular for premium quality)

**Text Models:**
- **Basic responses**: 100,000+ per Pollen
- **Premium responses**: ~1,000 per Pollen

Free models always cost 0 Pollen.

## What can I create with 10 Pollen?

With just 10 Pollen (=$10), you can generate:

- **500 nanobanana images** — premium quality AI art that's perfect for professional projects
- **3,300 turbo images** — rapid prototyping and quick iterations  
- **2,000 kontext images** — balanced quality for most use cases
- **770 gptimage images** — GPT-powered visual generation
- **100,000+ basic text responses** — chatbot conversations, content generation
- **10,000 premium text responses** — advanced reasoning and analysis
- **Unlimited flux images** — completely free, always!

Remember: your daily Pollen grants keep adding up, so registered users can create even more without spending their purchased Pollen balance.

## Will free models always be free?

Yes! Free models remain free forever for all users. We're committed to keeping AI accessible. Paid options only apply to premium models that offer additional capabilities.

## How does my Pollen wallet work?

One Pollen wallet for all your apps. Top up with Pollen anytime, use it anywhere across the Pollinations ecosystem.

## What's coming next?

- **In-app purchases** (early 2026) — let your users buy Pollen in your app, you get a bonus
- **More models** — video, real-time audio, expanding the catalog
- **Ads plugin** (2026) — earn Pollen when users see ads
- **Quests** — earn Pollen by starring projects, building cool stuff, etc.
