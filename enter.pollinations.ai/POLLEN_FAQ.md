# FAQ

## What is Pollen?

Pollen is our credit system. $1 = 1 Pollen. You spend it on API calls. Free models cost 0 Pollen (we just track usage for stats).

## How do I get Pollen?

Two ways:
- **Buy packs** with your credit card — goes straight to your wallet, never expires
- **Redeem sponsorship coupons** — temporary Pollen that gets used first, expires 24h after you claim it

## What payment methods do you accept?

Credit cards for now. We're looking into crypto and other options for people in countries with payment restrictions.

## Is there a monthly subscription?

Not yet, but we're considering it based on community feedback. Check out the [voting issue](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/issues/2202) to share your thoughts or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pollinations) for updates.

## Can I try it without signing up or paying?

Yep! Just hit the API — no signup needed. Free models work instantly, no Pollen required.

## What changes when I register?

You keep the free models (with rate limits) and unlock paid models (no rate limits, just costs Pollen). Plus you get daily free Pollen grants.

## How do daily grants work?

Every day at 00:00 UTC, registered users get free Pollen. It's spent before your purchased balance.

We have three tiers: **Seed** (default), **Flower**, and **Nectar**. Higher tiers get more daily Pollen. You can request an upgrade in your dashboard.

## How much Pollen do models use?

Each model uses different amounts of Pollen based on what it costs us to run. We'll have a Pollen cost page launching soon where you can see what each model uses. Free models always cost 0 Pollen.

## Will free models always be free?

Yes! We're committed to keeping basic models free and accessible. Only premium models cost Pollen.

## How does my wallet work?

One wallet for all your apps. Top up anytime, use it anywhere.

## What's coming next?

- **In-app purchases** (early 2026) — let your users buy Pollen in your app, you get a bonus
- **More models** — video, real-time audio, expanding the catalog
- **Ads plugin** (2026) — earn Pollen when users see ads
- **Quests** — earn Pollen by starring projects, building cool stuff, etc.
