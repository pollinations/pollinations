# FAQ

## What is Pollen?

Pollen is our prepaid credit system. $1 = 1 Pollen (beta). You spend it on API calls. Free models cost 0 Pollen — we just track usage for stats.

## How do I get Pollen?

Two ways:
- **Buy packs** with your credit card — goes straight to your wallet, never expires
- **Redeem sponsorship coupons** — temporary Pollen that gets used first, expires 24h after you claim it

## What payment methods do you accept?

Credit cards for now. We're looking into crypto and other options for people in countries with payment restrictions.

## Is there a monthly subscription?

Not yet, but we're considering it based on community feedback. Check out the [voting issue](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/issues/2202) to share your thoughts or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pollinations) for updates.

## Can I try it without signing up or paying?

Yep! Just hit the API — no signup needed. Free models work instantly, no Pollen required.

## What changes when I register?

You keep the free models (with rate limits) and unlock paid models (no rate limits, just costs Pollen). Plus you get daily free Pollen grants.

## How do daily grants work?

Every day at 00:00 UTC, registered users get free Pollen. It's spent before your purchased balance.

We have three tiers: **Seed** (default), **Flower**, and **Nectar**. Higher tiers get more daily Pollen. You can request an upgrade in your dashboard.

## How much Pollen do models use?

Each model uses different amounts of Pollen based on what it costs us to run. We'll have a Pollen cost page launching soon where you can see what each model uses. Free models always cost 0 Pollen.

## Will free models always be free?

Yes! Free models remain free forever for all users. We're committed to keeping AI accessible. Paid options only apply to premium models that offer additional capabilities.

## How does my wallet work?

One wallet for all your apps. Top up anytime, use it anywhere.

## What's coming next?

- **In-app purchases** (early 2026) — let your users buy Pollen in your app, you get a bonus
- **More models** — video, real-time audio, expanding the catalog
- **Ads plugin** (2026) — earn Pollen when users see ads
- **Quests** — earn Pollen by starring projects, building cool stuff, etc.
