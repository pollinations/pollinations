# Terms of Service

## what Myceli.AI is

We develop and operate **commercial, hosted services** built on the open-source **pollinations.ai** codebase. We provide the dashboard/API, billing and support, and—where applicable—service commitments. The open-source code remains licensed under its respective repository licences.

---

## 1) accounts & access

Provide accurate registration/billing details and keep credentials secure. Betas/experiments are provided “as is”.

## 2) the service

Hosted access to model-powered tools, dashboards, and APIs per your plan’s usage limits. We may make non-breaking changes and will notify you of material reductions.

## 3) customer data & privacy

* **Ownership:** you retain all rights to data you submit (“Customer Data”).
* **Processing:** we process Customer Data to provide/secure the Service, prevent abuse, and improve core functionality.
* **Content storage:** prompts/outputs are processed **transiently** to deliver results. We don’t retain them beyond what’s necessary to run the Service, except configuration you choose to save and legally required logs/billing records.
* **No training without opt-in:** we **do not** use your prompts/outputs to train models without your permission.
* **GDPR/DPA:** when we process personal data on your behalf, you are controller and we are processor. Our **DPA** is incorporated by reference and **available on request**.
* **Sub-processors:** **available on request**; we’ll give at least **14 days’** prior notice of material changes.
* **Security:** a concise security overview is **available on request**.

## 4) acceptable use & safety

Don’t violate law; infringe IP/likeness/privacy; attack the Service; evade rate limits; or replicate non-public features to build a competing hosted service. **No deepfakes of real people without consent. No CSAM (real or fictional).**

## 5) fees, taxes & billing

* **Fees** per plan/order/invoice.
* **Currency:** unless stated otherwise, billing is in **EUR**.
* **Taxes:** prices are **net of VAT**; we charge **Estonian VAT (22%)** where applicable. For eligible EU B2B customers, **reverse-charge** rules apply with a valid VAT ID.
* **Check:** **gross = net × 1.22**.
* **Payment:** via dashboard/invoice by due date; late amounts may accrue **1.5%/month** (or legal max). We may suspend for non-payment after notice.
* **Price changes:** **outside beta**, we’ll provide at least **30 days’** notice of fee changes; you may cancel before the effective date. **During beta**, pricing may change; we’ll notify in-product when practicable.
* **Refunds:** unless required by law, fees are **non-refundable**.

## 6) IP & open-source

We and our licensors own the Service, models, and documentation. The Service may include or run against OSS; those components are governed by their licences. **Model licences vary**; verify before commercial use. Feedback may be used to improve the Service.

## 7) warranties & liability

We warrant reasonable skill and care. Otherwise the Service is **“as is”**.
**Cap:** each party’s aggregate liability is limited to **12 months of fees paid** by you.
**Exclusions:** no indirect/special/incidental/consequential damages or lost profits/data.
**Exceptions:** caps/exclusions don’t apply to payment obligations, confidentiality breaches, IP indemnity, or wilful misconduct.

## 8) confidentiality

Each party protects the other’s confidential information and uses it only for this relationship.

## 9) term; suspension; termination

Term begins on first access and continues per plan (usually month-to-month). Either party may terminate for uncured material breach after 30 days’ notice. On termination we delete/return Customer Data per the DPA within 30 days unless legal retention applies.

## 10) publicity; export; misc.

We may use your name/logo to identify you as a customer unless you opt out in writing. You will comply with export/sanctions controls. Assignment with consent (not unreasonably withheld); notices by email; severability; no waiver; force majeure. Order of precedence: Order Form → these Terms → DPA.

## 11) governing law & venue

**Estonia** / **Harju County Court (Tallinn)**.
