# Privacy Policy

**Updated: 2026-01-19**

## 1) Scope & Roles

This policy covers (a) the paid dashboard/API and (b) the pollinations.ai community website. For Discord/GitHub use, their policies also apply.

**Roles:** For our websites and account/billing, we are controller. When processing Customer Data on your behalf via the API, we are processor under the DPA.

## 2) Data We Process

* **Accounts & auth (commercial):** email, name/handle, org, password hash or SSO IDs, MFA status.
* **Billing (commercial):** plan, invoices, payment status, VAT ID, company details. Card data is handled by our payment provider; we do not store full card numbers.
* **Service usage & API metadata (commercial):** timestamps, endpoints/models, token/credit usage, rate-limit events, IP, user-agent, error logs.
* **Prompts/outputs (commercial & demos):** processed transiently/in-memory to deliver results; not retained beyond what's necessary to run the Service, except configuration you save and short-lived caches.
* **Community identifiers (community):** Discord ID/username (if you link or use our bots); GitHub username (if you contribute); email if you contact us.
* **Telemetry:** aggregated counters and performance metrics.
* **Support:** emails, tickets, in-app chats.

## 3) Purposes & Lawful Bases (GDPR)

* **Provide and improve services/sites** (contract; legitimate interests).
* **Security & abuse prevention** (legitimate interests).
* **Billing/tax/compliance** (legal obligations).
* **Analytics & product research** using aggregated/pseudonymised data (legitimate interests).
* **Marketing communications** (consent; opt-out anytime). All marketing emails include an unsubscribe link.

## 4) Model Training & Content Use

We do not use your prompts/outputs to train or fine-tune models without your permission. Any training requires explicit opt-in.

## 5) Cookies & SDKs

Essential cookies for login/session. Any non-essential analytics cookies/SDKs are opt-in via the banner; you can withdraw consent anytime and change preferences in the cookie settings (accessible in the page footer).

## 6) Sharing & Recipients

* **Service providers (sub-processors):** we use the **categories** described at /terms#dpa-subprocessors. **Full named list available on request; we give ≥14 days' prior notice of material changes.**

**Depending on your model/provider selection, prompts and outputs may be sent transiently to our **model/inference compute** sub-processors (see categories at /terms#dpa-subprocessors).**

* **Affiliates:** internal operations under this policy.
* **Authorities:** when required by law or to protect rights/safety.

We do not sell personal data.

## 7) International Transfers

Where data leaves the EEA, we use approved safeguards (e.g., EU Standard Contractual Clauses) and appropriate supplementary measures.

## 8) Retention

* **Account & billing records:** account term + 7 years (accounting/tax).
* **API usage metadata:** typically 24 months (billing, fraud, capacity).
* **Security/abuse logs:** 30–180 days (up to 12 months for incidents).
* **Support tickets:** up to 24 months after closure.
* **Backups:** encrypted, rolling 30–90 days.

**Deletion rule:** deletion date = last activity + retention period. On account deletion, personal data is deleted within 30 days except where legal retention applies.

## 9) Your Rights (GDPR)

Access, correction, deletion, restriction, portability, objection to legitimate-interest processing, and withdrawal of consent (cookies/marketing).

You can complain to your local authority or the Estonian Data Protection Inspectorate (AKI). **Contact:** hi@myceli.ai.

## 10) Security

TLS in transit; encryption at rest where stored; key management; least-privilege; admin 2FA; audit logs; vulnerability management; incident response.

## 11) Children

Services are for users 16+. If under-16 data was provided, contact us for removal.

## 12) Automated Decision-Making

No decisions producing legal or similarly significant effects. Rate-limiting/abuse prevention may be automated.

## 13) Changes

We may update this policy; we'll post the new date and, for material changes, give reasonable in-app or email notice.
