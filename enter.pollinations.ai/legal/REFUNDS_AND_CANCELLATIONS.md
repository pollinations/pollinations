# Refunds & Cancellations

**Updated: 2026-01-19**

## Refunds & Cancellations (digital API services & credits)

**Scope.** Applies to (a) paid credit top-ups used to call our AI media API ("Credits") and (b) any paid subscriptions we may introduce in the future.

All sales are final except where required by law. Our API is a digital service delivered immediately at purchase. Once we start performance, we cannot "return" usage.

**Credits (top-ups) — non-refundable upon purchase.** Credits are non-refundable upon purchase, including unused credits, except: (a) duplicate or unauthorized charge, (b) failure to provision Credits after payment, (c) a material, documented technical fault that prevents any use within a reasonable start period, or (d) where required by law. On any approved refund, associated credits/benefits are revoked.

**EU consumer withdrawal (14-day rule).** If you purchase as a consumer in the EEA, you normally have 14 days to withdraw from distance contracts. For digital services not supplied on a tangible medium, this right does not apply once you:

* expressly request immediate access, and
* acknowledge that you lose the withdrawal right once performance begins.

We present this consent at checkout and store proof (text + timestamp, order_id, user_id, consent_text_version, IP). If you do not give consent, we will delay supply or you may withdraw within 14 days.

**Refund eligibility (limited).** We may refund where required by law or when:

* duplicate or unauthorized charge is proven,
* we fail to provision Credits after payment, or
* a material, documented technical fault prevents any use within a reasonable start period.

**How to request.** Email hi@myceli.ai with order ID and account email. We aim to review within 5–10 business days; approved refunds return to the original payment method subject to payment-network timelines. Business days are calculated in EET/EEST (Tallinn).

**Chargebacks.** If a chargeback is filed, we may suspend access while it's investigated and revoke Credits tied to the disputed order.

**B2B purchases.** If you provide a valid VAT ID and purchase for business use, consumer withdrawal rules generally do not apply.

**Effect of termination.** On any refund or termination, you must stop using the Service and not make API results available to third parties if the underlying order is canceled.
