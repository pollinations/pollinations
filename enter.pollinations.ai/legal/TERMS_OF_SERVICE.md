## 1) accounts & access

Provide accurate registration/billing details and keep credentials secure. Betas/experiments are provided “as is”.

## 2) beta services

Features, plans, or pricing labeled "beta" or "preview" may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time with in-product notice. This includes changes to:

- Tier structures and associated benefits (e.g., pollen allocations, daily limits)
- Model availability, capabilities, and per-model pricing
- Usage limits, quotas, and rate limits
- Feature availability and functionality

Beta features carry no service level commitments. By using beta features, you acknowledge this flexibility and agree that we are not liable for any changes made during the beta period.

## 3) the service

Hosted access to model-powered APIs and tools per your plan and usage limits. We may make non-breaking changes and will notify you of material reductions.

## 4) customer data & privacy

- **Ownership.** You retain all rights to data you submit ("Customer Data").
- **Processing.** We process Customer Data to provide and secure the Service, prevent abuse, and improve core functionality.
- **Content storage.** Prompts/outputs are processed transiently/in-memory to deliver results and are not retained beyond what's necessary to run the Service, except configuration you choose to save and legally required logs/billing records.
- **No training without opt-in.** We do not use prompts/outputs to train models without your permission.
- **GDPR/DPA.** When we process personal data on your behalf, you are the controller and we are the processor. Our DPA and sub-processor list are linked at /terms#dpa-subprocessors.

## 5) acceptable use & safety

Don’t violate law; infringe IP/likeness/privacy; attack the Service; evade rate limits; or replicate non-public features to build a competing hosted service. **No deepfakes of real people without consent. No CSAM (real or fictional).**

## 6) fees, taxes & billing

Fees per plan/order/invoice; currency by default EUR.

**Taxes.** Prices are net of VAT; we charge Estonian VAT (22%) where applicable. For eligible EU B2B customers with a valid VAT ID, reverse-charge rules apply.
**Check:** gross = net × 1.22.

**Merchant of Record.** Payments are processed by Polar acting as Merchant of Record where applicable.

**Payment & late fees.** Pay by due date; late amounts may accrue 1.5%/month (or legal max). We may suspend for non-payment after notice.

**Price changes.** Outside beta, we'll give 30 days' notice of fee changes; you may cancel before the effective date. During beta, pricing may change with in-product notice.

## 7) refunds & cancellations (digital services & credits)

All sales are final except where required by law. Our APIs deliver digital services immediately after purchase or top-up.

**EU consumer withdrawal.** If you purchase as a consumer in the EU, you have a 14-day right of withdrawal for distance contracts. For digital content/services delivered immediately, this right is waived when you expressly consent to immediate delivery and acknowledge loss of the withdrawal right. We present this consent at checkout.

**Consent text:** "I request immediate access to the digital service and acknowledge that I will lose my 14-day withdrawal right once performance begins."

**Credits (top-ups) — non-refundable upon purchase.** Credits are non-refundable upon purchase, including unused credits, except: (a) duplicate or unauthorized charge, (b) failure to provision Credits after payment, (c) a material, documented technical fault that prevents any use within a reasonable start period, or (d) where required by law. On any approved refund, associated credits/benefits are revoked.

**How to request.** Contact hi@myceli.ai with order ID and account email. Refunds are returned to the original payment method subject to payment-network timelines.

**Chargebacks.** Unpaid/charged-back amounts may lead to suspension; we will revoke associated credits/benefits.

## 8) IP & open-source

We and our licensors own the Service, models, and documentation. The Service may include or run against OSS; those components are governed by their licences. **Model licences vary**; verify before commercial use. Feedback may be used to improve the Service.

## 9) service level & support

Commercially reasonable efforts to maintain availability (target 99.5% monthly). We provide support via the channels on our site; SLA credits (if any) are set in your Order Form.

## 10) warranties & liability

We warrant reasonable skill and care. Otherwise the Service is **“as is”**.
**Cap:** each party’s aggregate liability is limited to **12 months of fees paid** by you.
**Exclusions:** no indirect/special/incidental/consequential damages or lost profits/data.
**Exceptions:** caps/exclusions don’t apply to payment obligations, confidentiality breaches, IP indemnity, or wilful misconduct.

## 11) confidentiality

Each party protects the other’s confidential information and uses it only for this relationship.

## 12) term; suspension; termination

Term begins on first access and continues per plan. Either party may terminate for uncured material breach after 30 days' notice. On termination we delete/return Customer Data per the DPA within 30 days unless legal retention applies. **Survival:** fees, confidentiality, IP, warranties & liability, and governing law survive.

## 13) publicity; export; changes; misc.

We may use your name/logo to identify you as a customer unless you opt out in writing. You will comply with export/sanctions controls. Assignment with consent (not unreasonably withheld); notices by email; severability; no waiver; force majeure. We may update these Terms; for material adverse changes we give reasonable prior notice. Order of precedence: Order Form → these Terms → DPA.

## 14) governing law & venue

**Estonia** / **Harju County Court (Tallinn)**.

## 15) DPA & sub-processors {#dpa-subprocessors}

When we process personal data on your behalf, you are the **controller** and we are the **processor** under our Data Processing Addendum (DPA). The DPA (including EU Standard Contractual Clauses for international transfers) and our current list of **sub-processors** are maintained at this location. We provide at least **14 days'** prior notice of material changes to sub-processors.

**Categories of sub-processors** we may use to deliver the Service:

- **Payments / Merchant of Record**
- **CDN/WAF & edge routing**
- **Cloud infrastructure & storage (EU-first)**
- **Email / notifications**
- **Analytics / data pipeline**
- **Model / inference compute providers** (for text/image/video generation)

**Data residency.** We route jobs to **EU regions by default**. If a model/provider is only available outside the EEA, we use appropriate safeguards (e.g., SCCs) and only enable upon project-level opt-in.

We'll email workspace owners on sub-processor changes.
