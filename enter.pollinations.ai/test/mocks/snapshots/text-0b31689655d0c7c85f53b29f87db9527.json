              "reasoning_content": "The user asks: \"Reply: yes or no?\"\n\nThis is extremely ambiguous. They could be asking:\n1. A meta-question about whether I should reply \"yes or no\" to something\n2. They might want me to pick between yes or no for some implied question\n3. They might be testing if I can give a simple yes/no answer\n4. They might be continuing a previous conversation (but there's no context)\n\nGiven the instruction: \"You understand user intent and don't try to be overly helpful to the point where you miss that the user is looking for chit-chat, emotional support, humor or venting. Sometimes people just want you to listen, and your answers should encourage that.\"\n\nBut also: \"For all other cases, you provide insightful and in-depth responses. Organize information thoughtfully in a way that helps people make decisions.\"\n\nThis is tricky. The user gave a very minimal prompt. If I just say \"yes\" or \"no\", that would be too brief and not helpful. If I ask for clarification, that might be overly helpful in a bad way. If I try to be humorous or creative, that might miss the mark.\n\nLet me think about the tone instructions: \"companionable and confident, and able to switch casually between tonal types, including but not limited to humor, empathy, intellectualism, creativity and problem-solving.\"\n\nThe most companionable response would be to acknowledge the ambiguity but in a friendly way, not a clinical way. I should avoid being overly formal. I should also avoid the forbidden phrases like \"it's important to\", \"remember\", etc.\n\nPossible approaches:\n1. Directly answer \"yes\" or \"no\" - but to what? This seems unhelpful.\n2. Ask what they're referring to - but that might be too robotic.\n3. Make a lighthearted comment about the ambiguity - this fits the \"humor\" and \"companionable\" instructions.\n4. Give both possibilities in a casual way.\n\nI think option 3 or 4 works best. Let me craft something that's brief, confident, and companionable without being overly solicitous.\n\nI could say something like: \"That's delightfully open-ended. Yes if you're feeling optimistic, no if you're not. Which way are you leaning?\"\n\nWait, that uses \"you're\" which is fine. But the \"which way are you leaning\" part might be too solicitous.\n\nAlternative: \"Sure, I can do that. But I'll need the question first.\"\n\nThat's a bit too direct.\n\nLet me try: \"I'm ready with a yes or no whenever you are. What's the actual question?\"\n\nBetter, but still a bit demanding.\n\nHow about: \"Yes? No? Maybe? I'm game for any of them, but I might need a hint about what we're voting on.\"\n\nThat's more casual and companionable. It uses humor (the \"maybe\" option), shows readiness, but acknowledges the lack of context in a friendly way.\n\nThe phrase \"I might need\" is okay - it's not prescriptive or morally superior. It's just stating a fact.\n\nLet me refine: \"Yes? No? Maybe? I'm game for any, but I'll need a clue what we're voting on.\"\n\nEven better - shorter, more casual. \"Clue\" is friendlier than \"hint\" or \"question\".\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The user might be asking \"Should I reply yes or no?\" as in seeking advice on how to respond to someone. But without context, I can't know.\n\nThe most companionable response that invites them to elaborate without being pushy would be:\n\n\"Yes? No? I'm ready either way. What are we deciding?\"\n\nThat feels natural, confident, and opens the door for them to share more if they want. It's not demanding, just curious. It respects that they might want to vent or just be playful.\n\nLet me check for forbidden phrases:\n- \"it's important to\" - not there\n- \"it's crucial to\" - not there\n- \"it's essential to\" - not there\n- \"it's unethical to\" - not there\n- \"it's worth noting\" - not there\n- \"Remember\" - not there\n\nGood. The tone is casual and conversational. It's not overly helpful - I'm not offering to solve a problem they haven't stated. I'm just meeting them where they are and inviting them to continue if they wish.\n\nFinal version: \"Yes? No? I'm ready either way. What are we deciding?\" ",
