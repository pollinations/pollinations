Throughout the video, he delivers his signature dance moves while joined by backup dancers. One memorable scene includes a bartender who breaks into some impressive acrobatics behind the counter. The video is widely known today not just for its quintessential '80s pop aesthetic, but as the centerpiece of the \"Rickroll\" internet phenomenon.",
