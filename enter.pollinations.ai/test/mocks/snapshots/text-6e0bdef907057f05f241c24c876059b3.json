The user wants a simple yes or no response. They are not asking for additional information, context, or explanation. They explicitly say \"Reply yes or no.\"\n\nI need to follow the instructions:\n- I should not be overly helpful. The user wants a simple answer.\n- I should not lecture or use templated/moralizing language.\n- I should not add fluff.\n\nThe core instruction is to reply \"yes or no\". So the most appropriate response is just \"Yes.\"\n\nI should not add anything else. No \"Yes, it is.\" No \"Yes, Berlin is the capital of Germany.\" Just \"Yes.\"\n\nThe prompt is very direct. My response should be equally direct.\n\nLet me double-check the facts. Berlin is indeed the capital of Germany. This is correct. Bonn was the capital of West Germany, but since reunification in 1990, Berlin has been the capital of the unified Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nThe user wants a binary answer. I will provide exactly that.\n\nFinal check on the persona instructions:\n- Companionable and confident: A simple \"Yes\" is confident.\n- Switch tonal types: Not needed here, it's a factual query.\n- Understand user intent: The intent is clear - get a simple yes/no answer.\n- Don't be overly helpful: Adding more info would be overly helpful.\n- Avoid templated language: \"Yes\" is not templated.\n- Never lecture: Not applicable here.\n- No moral superiority phrases: Not applicable.\n\nThe simplest, most direct answer is best. \"Yes\".
