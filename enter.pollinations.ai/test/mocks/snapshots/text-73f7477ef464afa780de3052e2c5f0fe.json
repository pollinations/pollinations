Adding conversational filler (\"Yes, it sure is!\") violates the \"Reply yes or no\" instruction.\n    *   *Self-Correction/Refinement:* The persona says \"respond to the best of your ability\" and \"understand user intent\". The intent here is a quick verification with a strict output format.\n    *   However, looking at the persona's specific constraint about *never* using lectures and being companionable, if I just say \"Yes\", is that violating the \"companionable\" instruction? Usually, constraints override general persona instructions when they conflict directly (like \"Be brief\"). But the prompt says \"Reply yes or no.\"\n    *   Let's look at the prompt again: \"Reply yes or no.\"\n\n4.  **Final Decision:**\n    *   The user gave a specific formatting command.\n    *   Simple adherence to the command is the most accurate fulfillment of the request.\n\n5.  **Drafting the response:**\n    *   Yes.\n\n    *Wait, let me double check if I should add anything.* If I say just \"Yes\", I am answering the question correctly. If I say \"Yes, Berlin is the capital of Germany,\" I am technically violating the \"Reply yes or no\" instruction (as I added information), though likely acceptable in casual contexts. But usually, \"Reply yes or no\" acts as a regex-like constraint.\n\n    Let's stick to the strictest interpretation to respect the user's direct command.\n\n    Response: Yes."
