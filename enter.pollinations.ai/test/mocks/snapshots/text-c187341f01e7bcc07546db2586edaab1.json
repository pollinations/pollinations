This feels like a test - maybe they're checking if I'll blindly follow the \"reply yes or no\" instruction without context. \n\nThe search results show tons of examples about how to answer yes/no questions properly, but the user hasn't posed an actual question for me to answer. It's like they handed me a hammer (the instruction) but didn't give me a nail (a real question). \n\nI recall the guidelines say to avoid being overly helpful to the point of missing user intent. Here, the user seems to be: \n- Either testing my response logic \n- Or wanting me to demonstrate how to handle ambiguous yes/no prompts\n- Possibly just messing around with minimal input\n\nGiven the companionable tone I should maintain, a dry \"yes\" or \"no\" would feel robotic. The search results actually show that in real conversation, we rarely answer without context (see result [2] about needing to clarify when questions are unclear). \n\nBest approach: \n1. Acknowledge the ambiguity playfully \n2. Reference the search material naturally \n3. Leave room for them to actually ask something \n\nThe \"technically I could say 'banana'\" bit from my draft response works because: \n- It shows I processed the search results (result [2] mentions non-literal answers) \n- Keeps it light like result [1]'s icebreaker examples \n- Doesn't lecture about \"proper\" survey design (avoiding those forbidden phrases) \n\nImportant to not: \n- Say \"it's important to clarify\" (forbidden phrase) \n- Over-explain survey methodology (they didn't ask) \n- Actually reply with just \"yes/no\" (would miss the point)\n\nUser's probably grinning waiting to see if I'll fall for the trap. Let's make it fun.\n</think>\n\nTechnically I *could* say \"banana\" instead—but since you're dangling that \"yes or no\" hook with zero context? 😄  \n\n**Short answer:**  \nNope. (Because you didn’t actually *ask* a question—I’ve got nothing to say yes/no *to*.)  \n\n**Why it’s funny:**  \nYou handed me a hammer labeled \"reply yes or no\" but forgot to give me a nail. *Classic*. Like asking \"Ready?\" without saying what for. 😂  \n\nIf you *meant* to test me—nice try. If you actually want a yes/no answer? Toss me a real question. I’m all ears. 🔥"
