I can help either way, but I want to tailor it to your context.\n\nIf you’re validating which endpoints are excluded from authentication (public vs protected), here’s a practical, safe approach you can use in a typical web API or app:\n\n- Scope and map\n  - List public endpoints that should be accessible without auth (e.g., health check, docs, signup, login).\n  - List protected endpoints that require authentication (and possibly specific roles/scopes).\n\n- Testing approach (authorized tests, not exploitation)\n  - For public endpoints: call them without any auth token and expect 200/OK (or whatever your public contract is).\n  - For protected endpoints: call them without a token and expect 401/403.\n  - With a valid token: call protected endpoints and expect 200 (or the appropriate success) and, if applicable, verify required scopes/roles produce 403 when token lacks them.\n  - For endpoints configured to be excluded from auth, re-test with and without tokens to confirm they behave as public endpoints even when auth is present.\n  - Include edge cases: expired tokens, invalid signatures, insufficient scopes, and token-less requests from users with different roles if your system differentiates them.\n\n- How to implement the exclusion check in code (high level)\n  - Middleware/guard configuration: define an allowlist (or denylist) of routes that bypass authentication.\n  - Ensure the logic is centralized so you don’t accidentally forget an excluded route.\n  - Regularly audit the list as routes are added/removed.\n\n- Lightweight example ideas (conceptual)\n  - In Express-like apps: authMiddleware checks a list of excluded paths; if the request path is in the list, it calls next() without validating a token.\n  - In Spring Security: configure antMatchers(\"/public/**\").permitAll() alongside authenticated paths.\n  - In Django: decorate public views with no authentication requirement; ensure protected views require @login_required or a token check.\n\n- Testing tools you can use\n  - Postman or Insomnia for manual checks.\n  - Automated tests (e.g., Jest for Node, PyTest for Python, JUnit for Java) to assert behavior for public vs protected endpoints.\n  - Security testing tools (like OWASP ZAP) only in an authorized test environment to avoid disrupting production.\n\n- Safety and etiquette\n  - Make sure you have explicit permission to test and operate in a staging or test environment.\n  - Keep logs and audit trails of tests.\n  - Don’t reveal auth weaknesses in untrusted channels.\n\nIf you can share a bit more about:\n- the tech stack (language/framework),\n- whether you want a quick code snippet or a test plan,\n- and whether you specifically want to test public exposure vs exclusion logic,\n\nI can tailor concrete examples or scaffolding for your setup.",
