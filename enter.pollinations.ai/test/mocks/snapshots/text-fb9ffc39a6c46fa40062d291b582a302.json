I can help you with a quick, practical test plan, or I can run a tiny two-pass test right here if you want.\n\nA simple cache-test plan you can run\n- Step 1: Pick two prompts that are exactly the same text (Prompts A and A′ identical).\n- Step 2: Submit Prompt A twice in a row and note: response content, length, and timestamp.\n- Step 3: Submit a near-identical prompt (Prompts B and B′ with a minor difference, e.g., a punctuation tweak or capitalization) and note the same details.\n- Step 4: Compare results:\n  - If identical or nearly identical outputs appear for Prompt A A′, that hints at some caching or deterministic behavior for identical inputs.\n  - If Prompt B and B′ produce different outputs, it suggests the change in the prompt affects the result (as expected) and helps you see how sensitive the system is to small changes.\n- Optional: Measure latency for each run to see if caches reduce response time.\n\nA quick two-pass test you can run with me now\n- Tell me a single exact prompt you want tested, or paste Prompt X.\n- I’ll respond to Prompt X twice in a row and we can compare the two outputs here.\n\nIf you want, I can also explain what to expect about caching in typical LLM deployments and how to design prompts to be cache-friendly or cache-resistant, depending on your goal. What would you like to do?"
