## 📧 EMAIL TODAY - Data & Benchmark Questions

*These are concrete, factual questions that Antler can prepare answers for.*

### CLA / Contract Structure
1. Which CLA templates do you currently see most frequently for seed rounds like Pollinations? Can you provide us with one?
2. Are there clauses (e.g. MFN) that you absolutely want to have as our first investor?

### Cap & Discount (Benchmarks)
3. What cap ranges do you currently see for comparable seed rounds?
4. What discount ranges do you consider market standard?
5. In practice, do CLAs work better with cap only or with cap + discount?
6. At what cap would you say it becomes problematic for the next round?

### MFN Clause
7. How do you typically handle MFN clauses in CLAs?
8. Do you see MFN more as standard or as a negotiation point?
9. Would you prefer to limit MFN in time (e.g. until first close)?
10. Are there MFN formulations that you would clearly not recommend?

### Estonian Setup
11. Any concerns or considerations regarding the Estonian legal structure?
