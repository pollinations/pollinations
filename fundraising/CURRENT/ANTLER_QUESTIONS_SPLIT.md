## � KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. **Lead investor sets the terms** - Don't spend time deciding CLA vs SAFE vs priced round. The lead investor will tell you.
2. **Your job**: Know your ask (€1.5-3M), say "market standard valuation", let investors propose terms.
3. **Typical dilution**: 17-22% for seed rounds at this size.
4. **Don't run angel + institutional in parallel** - Word travels. Do one or the other.
5. **Focus all intensity on getting a lead investor first**, then fill remaining allocation with angels.

## 💬 Q&A FROM MEETING

### CLA / Contract Structure
**Q1: Which CLA templates do you see most frequently?**
> **A**: Depends on round size. For €3M territory in Germany → likely notarized priced round. For €1.5M → more likely convertible or SAFE. Convertible is more common. **The lead investor will determine the legal shape.**

**Q2: Are there clauses (e.g. MFN) you want as first investor?**
> **A**: Not yours to set at this point. Antler has pro-rata rights in existing CLA. That's the extent of it. **Wait for the term sheet** - don't pre-negotiate terms.

### Cap & Discount (Benchmarks)
**Q3: What cap ranges for comparable seed rounds?**
> **A**: Cap = valuation (in convertible context). **Don't set this yourself.** When asked "what valuation are you shooting for?", say: *"I'm looking to raise €2M at typical market standard valuation levels."* Investors know: 17-22% dilution is standard. For €2M at 20% dilution = €10M post-money valuation.

**Q4: What discount ranges are market standard?**
> **A**: **Only relevant for angel rounds**, not institutional. For quick angel rounds (€300-600K):
> - 10% discount = very founder-friendly
> - 20% discount = market standard  
> - 30% = also seen
> 
> For €1.5M+ institutional rounds, this question is irrelevant.

**Q5: Do CLAs work better with cap only or cap + discount?**
> **A**: *"Spend zero time on whether CLA or SAFE is better right now - that's a luxury problem to have."*

**Q6: At what cap does it become problematic for next round?**
> **A**: Not discussed - but implied: let investors set the cap/valuation.

### MFN Clause
**Q7-10: MFN questions**
> **A**: Not discussed in detail. Key point: **Antler has pro-rata rights** in existing agreement. Other terms are set by lead investor.

### Estonian Setup
**Q11: Any concerns about Estonian legal structure?**
> **A**: (via WhatsApp with Alan, Feb 5)
> - **Not a blocker** for fundraising
> - Would be easier with a GmbH, but only marginally
> - "You have bigger fish to fry"
> - **Bigger risk at DD stage**: The Outlier Ventures situation that's still unresolved

## 🎯 FUNDRAISING STRATEGY (from meeting)

### The Process
1. Investors meet you → assess people + business + storyline
2. If interested → "We'll go into DD, can you share the data room?"
3. Data room = financial model, cap table, existing documents (Antler CLA)
4. Before/after investment committee → due diligence on existing docs
5. **Term sheet** → includes valuation, round size, legal structure, expiry (1-2 weeks)
6. Then you negotiate

### Round Structure (typical €2M example)
- Lead fund: €1.2-1.5M (they want 15%+ ownership minimum)
- Antler pro-rata: ~€150K
- Remaining €350K: Fill with angels (often lead helps with intros)

### If Fundraise Drags
- Can do "first close" with angels who committed earlier
- But **don't run angel + institutional rounds in parallel**
- If no traction after 50 conversations → go "code red" → pivot to angel round, pause institutional
