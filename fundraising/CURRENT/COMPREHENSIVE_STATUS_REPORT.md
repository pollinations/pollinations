## 🏗️ BUSINESS MODEL: The Pollen Economy

### Three-Layer Model
1. **Layer 1 - Developer Pays** (Current): Devs buy Pollen for AI features ($1 = 5000 images)
2. **Layer 2 - User Pays** (Emerging): End users buy Pollen directly (Roblox integration)
3. **Layer 3 - Pollen as Economy** (Future): Virtual currency for rewards, incentives, trading

### Revenue Streams
- **Pollen GMV**: End-user purchases (primary growth driver)
- **Dev Top-Ups**: B2B revenue from developers
- **Ads Revenue**: Sponsored model placements + affiliate

### Platform Economics
- **Fees**: 4% of GMV + 15% of Ads
- **Gross Margin**: 75%
- **Take Rate**: TBD (Roblox takes ~30%)

## 🎯 PITCH FRAMEWORK (SCQA)

### SITUATION
AI is everywhere. Technical moats are disappearing. Everyone can build apps now.

### COMPLICATION
- **API fragmentation** — different APIs, keys, billing per provider
- **Credit card barrier** — teens globally can't even start
- **Financial risk** — app goes viral → massive unexpected bill
- **No support system** — alone with docs and YouTube

### QUESTION
How do you experiment, start, build, learn — and grow with a community?

### ANSWER
**One API. Free to start. Community that levels up with you.**

## 🆚 COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

| Factor | Pollinations | Competitors (FAL, Replicate, OpenRouter) |
|--------|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Target User** | Indie devs, hobbyists, teens | Enterprise, production developers |
| **Entry Barrier** | No signup required | Credit card, API keys |
| **Pricing** | $1 = 5000 images | Higher minimums, subscriptions |
| **Community** | 17K+ Discord, active support | Minimal (docs only) |
| **User Journey** | Consumer → contributor pipeline | One-way customer relationship |

### FAL AI Comparison (from Jan 28 meeting)
- FAL: $500M funding, 99% revenue from enterprise
- FAL's 17K Discord generates <1% revenue (marketing tool)
- **Pollinations differentiation**: Front-end API usage without backend setup

## ⚠️ ITEMS REQUIRING ATTENTION

### 1. Historical Investor Relations
- Review and update communication with previous investors
- Ensure cap table documentation is current
- **Action**: Prepare summary of all existing investor relationships

### 2. Entity Confusion
- **Myceli OÜ** = legal entity (Estonia)
- **Pollinations** = brand
- **Old Pollinations GmbH** = still exists, trying to close (~€2K/year)
- **Messaging**: "Myceli OÜ, operating as Pollinations"
