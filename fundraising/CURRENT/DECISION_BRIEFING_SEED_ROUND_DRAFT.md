# 🗳️ Decision Briefing: Seed Round Structure

> **⚠️ DRAFT - For Internal Review Only**

**Purpose**: Fast-track P0 decisions for Thomas & Elliot.
**Goal**: Lock these parameters by Feb 5 to start investor meetings.

## 1. Round Structure
**Recommendation**: **Post-Money SAFE (Standard YC Template)**
*   **Why**:
    *   **Speed**: No legal negotiation on terms, just cap/discount.
    *   **Standard**: Investors expect it. CLA is older/messier for Seed.
    *   **Clarity**: Dilution is fixed and clear immediately.
*   **Alternative**: CLA (Convertible Loan Agreement)
    *   *Pros*: Maturity date (pressure), debt ranking.
    *   *Cons*: Interest rate complexity, heavier legal review.
    *   *Verdict*: Avoid unless German legal specifics force it (Myceli GmbH context).

## 2. Raise Amount & Runway
**Recommendation**: **€2.0M Target** (Range: €1.5M – €2.5M)
*   **Runway**: **24 Months** (until Q1 2028)
*   **Burn Logic**:
    *   Current: ~€25K/mo (lean)
    *   Year 1 Avg: ~€60K/mo (hiring core team)
    *   Year 2 Avg: ~€100K/mo (scaling infra + team)
    *   Total 2-Year Burn: ~€1.9M + Buffer
*   **Milestone Enabled**: Reach Series A metrics (€200K MRR, 150K devs).

## 3. Valuation Cap
**Recommendation**: **€10M – €12M Post-Money Cap**
*   **Logic**:
    *   **AI Premium**: Market pays 1.3x for AI infra.
    *   **Traction**: 3M MAU + 600 daily devs is Top 5% seed traction.
    *   **Dilution**: €2M on €10M cap = 20% dilution (Healthy standard).
    *   **Antler Floor**: Antler is at ~€5M. We need to be significantly higher (2x) to show growth.

## 4. Lead Investor Profile
**Recommendation**: **"The Developer-First VCs"**
We need a lead who understands *Community as a Moat* and *Bottom-Up Adoption*.
*   **Archetypes**:
    *   **The "Dev Tools" Specialist**: (e.g., Point Nine, Boldstart, Heavybit) - they get SDKs and APIs.
    *   **The "Gen Z Consumer" Believer**: (e.g., consumer partners at a16z, Benchmark) - they get "Vibe Coding".
    *   **The "Open Source" Thesis**: (e.g., OSS Capital) - they value the GitHub flywheel.
