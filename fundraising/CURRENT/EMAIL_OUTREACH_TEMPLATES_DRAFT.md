## 🏗️ Template A: The "Dev Tools" Pitch
**Target**: Point Nine (Christoph/Louis), Seedcamp (Sia), OSS Capital (JJ)
**Focus**: Infrastructure, adoption, bottom-up growth.

**Subject**: Pollinations.ai (Seed): The "Roblox for AI" / 600+ devs daily

**Body**:
Hi [Name],

We are building the infrastructure layer for the "Vibe Coding" generation.

Pollinations is a unified, permissionless API that aggregates all major AI models (OpenAI, Flux, Llama) into a single line of code. We are the on-ramp for the millions of young/indie developers who are currently locked out of enterprise platforms by credit card barriers and API fragmentation.

**Traction (Organic / $0 Marketing):**
*   **600+** new developers joining daily
*   **3M+** Monthly Active Users across the ecosystem
*   **1,000+** live apps (Chatbots, Games, Creative Tools)
*   **17K+** Discord community

**Business Model:**
We are flipping the model from "devs pay for infra" to "end-users pay per generation" (micropayments), similar to Roblox. We have pilot apps live and generating revenue.

We are raising a **€2M Seed Round** to scale this economy. Given [VC Firm]'s thesis on [relevant portfolio co/thesis], I’d love to share our One Pager.

Best,

## 🎨 Template B: The "Gen Z / Consumer" Pitch
**Target**: Cherry (Jasper), Creandum, a16z Consumer
**Focus**: Creator economy, viral growth, democratizing access.

**Subject**: Pollinations.ai: 3M MAU AI ecosystem for Gen Z creators

**Body**:
Hi [Name],

83% of Gen Z identify as creators, but the current AI infrastructure stack (AWS, Replicate) is built for enterprise engineers, not them.

We built **Pollinations** to be the "Roblox for AI creation".
It’s a permissionless, free-to-start platform where any teen with an idea can build and deploy an AI app in seconds—without a credit card or backend experience.

**The organic response has been explosive:**
*   **3 Million** Monthly Active Users
*   **17,000** Discord members (highly active co-creation)
*   **1,000+** Apps created by the community
*   **Viral loops**: Our open-source "Pollen" economy rewards creators for code contributions.

We are raising a **€2M Seed Round** to capture this massive long-tail market that enterprise players are ignoring.

Are you open to a brief chat next week?

Best,

Thomas Haferlach
CEO, Pollinations.ai

## 🧠 Template C: The "AI Specialist" Pitch
**Target**: Air Street (Nathan), Technical Angels
**Focus**: Model aggregation, routing, technical moat.

**Subject**: Pollinations.ai: Aggregation layer for open models (Flux/Llama)

**Body**:
Hi [Name],

As models commoditize (Flux, Llama 3, etc.), the bottleneck shifts to **distribution** and **aggregation**.

**Pollinations** is the unified API gateway that solves this for the long tail. We aggregate open-source and proprietary models into a single, frontend-safe API. We handle the complexity (routing, load balancing, billing) so developers just write one line of code.

**Why it works:**
*   **Tech**: Zero-setup API routing to optimal providers (we are a distribution channel for Flux/Black Forest Labs).
*   **Scale**: 10.9B tokens/week processed. 600+ new devs/day.
*   **Moat**: 17K+ developer community contributing to our open-source stack.

We are raising **€2M** to scale our "User-Pays" inference economy. Given Air Street's deep focus on AI-first companies, I thought this would be relevant.

One Pager attached.

Best,

Thomas Haferlach
CEO, Pollinations.ai

## 🤝 Template D: The "Warm Intro" Blurb
**Context**: Send this to Antler partners or founders to forward on your behalf.

**Subject**: Intro to Pollinations.ai (3M MAU / 600+ daily devs)

**Body**:
Pollinations is building the "Roblox for AI"—a unified, permissionless infrastructure for the next generation of creators.

They are aggregating all major AI models (OpenAI, Flux, Llama) into a single API that requires no signup and no credit card. This has unlocked massive growth among "vibe coders" and indie devs.

**Highlights:**
*   **Traction**: 3M MAU, 1,000+ live apps, 600+ new devs/day (100% organic).
*   **Community**: 17K+ Discord members; open-source "Pollen" economy.
*   **Model**: Moving from dev-paid to user-paid (end-users pay micropayments per gen), unlocking the Roblox economic model for AI apps.

Thomas (CEO) is ex-Amazon AI and a deep technical founder. They are raising a €2M Seed round.

## 💡 Follow-Up (The "Bump")
**Timing**: 3-4 days after initial email if no response.

**Subject**: Re: Pollinations.ai

**Body**:
Hi [Name],

Just bubbling this up. Since my last note, we've crossed [insert new metric, e.g., "18K Discord members" or "another 500 devs joined"].

We're starting to schedule meetings for our Seed round next week and would love to include [VC Firm].

Best,
Thomas
