## The Core Message (Both Versions)

We're solving the broken economics of AI development through:
1. User-pays model (revolutionary like free-to-play gaming)
2. Open source everything (trust and contributions)
3. Community-driven development (5K builders)
4. Gamified proof-of-work (GitHub → Pollen credits)

Result: Democratizing AI entrepreneurship globally

## Delivery Tips

1. **Version A** if investor seems technical or community-minded

## What Makes These Unique

Unlike other AI companies:
- We don't compete on models (use all models)
- We don't charge developers (users pay)
- We don't hide our code (open source)
- We don't limit by geography (global from day one)
- We don't gatekeep (11 to 73 years old)

We're the economic infrastructure for the AI creative revolution.
