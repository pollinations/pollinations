## The Narrative Arc

### 1. The Origin (The Hunger)
*   **Visual**: Photo of a young Thomas (or generic "young coder" aesthetic) + code on screen.
*   **Text**: "Started coding at 13. Obsessed with AI. Outsider looking in."
*   **Voiceover**: "I remember the hunger. I had the ideas, but I was a kid in Brazil/Germany without a credit card. The doors were locked."

### 2. The Credibility (The Expertise)
*   **Visual**: Logos of University of Edinburgh, Amazon, Neural Networks Paper.
*   **Text**:
    *   **M.Sc. Artificial Intelligence** (Top of Class, Edinburgh)
    *   **Published Researcher** (Neural Networks, 201x)
    *   **Amazon AI**: Built recommendation systems at massive scale.
*   **Voiceover**: "I climbed the ladder. I got the degrees. I built AI for the biggest tech company in the world. I learned how the 'big guys' do it."

### 3. The Insight (The Gap)
*   **Visual**: Split screen. Left: "Enterprise AI" (Complex, Expensive). Right: "Vibe Coders" (Creative, Chaotic, Blocked).
*   **Text**: "The tools I used at Amazon are not built for the kid I used to be."
*   **Voiceover**: "But I realized something. The next wave of innovation isn't coming from Amazon. It's coming from the millions of kids 'vibe coding' right now. And they are facing the exact same walls I did 15 years ago."

### 4. The Mission (The Enabler)
*   **Visual**: Pollinations Community Map (Globe with connected nodes).
*   **Text**: **Pollinations.ai**
    *   "Building the platform I wished I had at 16."
    *   **CEO/Founder**: Thomas Haferlach
*   **Voiceover**: "So I quit to build the infrastructure for them. Permissionless. Accessible. Community-owned. We are unlocking the creativity of a generation."
