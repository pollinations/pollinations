> **⚠️ DRAFT v1 - For Internal Review Only**

**Created**: February 2, 2026  
**Source**: Meeting notes, strategy discussions  
**Status**: DRAFT - Needs Team Validation

## Executive Summary

Three primary GTM hypotheses for Pollinations, prioritized by confidence and resource requirements:

| # | Hypothesis | Confidence | Investment | Timeline |
|---|------------|------------|------------|----------|
| **1** | Roblox/Gaming Distribution | High | Low | Q1-Q2 2026 |
| **2** | Developer Community Flywheel | High | Low | Ongoing |
| **3** | AI Model Provider Partnerships | Medium | Medium | Q2-Q3 2026 |

---

## Hypothesis 1: Roblox/Gaming Distribution

### The Bet
> Games built on Pollinations will convert their players into Pollen purchasers, creating a user-pays flywheel where developers pay nothing and users fund their own AI usage.

### Evidence
- **Paas's Roblox game**: 51M visits, $12K earned
- **7+ Roblox games** already integrated
- **User-pays model** proven: Players buy Pollen to use AI features

### GTM Motion

```
Developer builds game → Game goes viral → Players want AI features
                                               ↓
                              Players buy Pollen (Robux → Pollen)
                                               ↓
                              Developer earns, Pollinations earns
                                               ↓
                              Success attracts more developers
```

### Key Metrics to Track
- Games integrated with user-pays
- Pollen GMV from Roblox
- Conversion rate (players → Pollen buyers)
- Revenue per game

### Actions (Q1-Q2 2026)
- [ ] Launch Roblox SDK with user-pays integration
- [ ] Onboard 10+ games with user-pays
- [ ] Document success stories for developer marketing
- [ ] Target: €80K GMV in Mar 2026

### Risks
- Roblox policy changes
- Low player conversion
- Single game dependency

---

## Hypothesis 2: Developer Community Flywheel

### The Bet
> Our 17K Discord community and open-source ethos will continue to drive organic growth at zero CAC, creating a self-sustaining flywheel of developers building and sharing.

### Evidence
- **600+ developers joining daily** (organic)
- **17K Discord members** helping each other
- **3.8K GitHub stars** 
- **Zero marketing spend** to date

### GTM Motion

```
Developer discovers Pollinations (GitHub, HN, Discord)
                    ↓
          Builds app with zero friction
                    ↓
         Shares app → Others discover Pollinations
                    ↓
          Community helps newcomers → Retention
                    ↓
         Power users become advocates → Growth
```

### Key Metrics to Track
- Daily new developer signups
- Discord engagement (DAU, messages)
- Apps published per week
- NPS / developer satisfaction

### Actions (Ongoing)
- [ ] Maintain Discord response time <2 hours
- [ ] Feature community apps weekly
- [ ] Run monthly hackathons/bounties
- [ ] Create tutorial content (YouTube, docs)

### Risks
- Community burnout
- Quality degradation at scale
- Competitor communities emerging

---

## Hypothesis 3: AI Model Provider Partnerships

### The Bet
> AI model providers (FAL, Together, etc.) will sponsor model placements and provide credits/discounts in exchange for distribution to our developer base.

### Evidence
- **Together AI** offered $250K + $500K credits
- Model providers need distribution channels
- Developers = valuable audience for AI companies

### GTM Motion

```
Partner provides credits/sponsorship
            ↓
Pollinations offers "sponsored" model tier
            ↓
Developers use sponsored models (free/discounted)
            ↓
Provider gets distribution, usage data, feedback
            ↓
Pollinations earns affiliate/placement fees
```

### Key Metrics to Track
- Partner credits secured
- Sponsored model usage
- Revenue from placements
- Developer satisfaction with partners

### Actions (Q2-Q3 2026)
- [ ] Close Together AI partnership
- [ ] Explore FAL, Replicate (Cloudflare) partnerships
- [ ] Create "Sponsored Models" tier
- [ ] Target: €100K/year in partnership revenue

### Risks
- Partner priorities change
- Credit programs end
- Quality issues with partner models

---

## Secondary Hypotheses (Lower Priority)

### 4. Enterprise/B2B Sales
- **Bet**: Larger companies will pay for dedicated support, SLAs, custom deployments
- **Status**: Not prioritized until post-Series A
- **Why Later**: Requires sales team, different motion

### 5. Education/Non-Profit Subsidies
- **Bet**: Grants and edu programs will fund free access for schools/NGOs
- **Status**: Opportunistic, not primary
- **Why**: Low revenue, high support cost

### 6. Geographic Expansion
- **Bet**: Localized products (China, LATAM) will unlock new markets
- **Status**: Not prioritized until platform stable
- **Why Later**: Regulatory complexity, localization cost

## GTM Principles

### What We Do
1. **Product-led growth** - No signup required, try instantly
2. **Community-first** - Discord as primary support channel
3. **Open source** - Transparency builds trust
4. **Developer advocacy** - Feature builders, not just product

### What We Don't Do (Yet)
1. ❌ Paid acquisition
2. ❌ Enterprise sales team
3. ❌ Trade shows / conferences
4. ❌ Content marketing at scale

|------------|-------------|------|
| Roblox/Gaming | 40% | Thomas, Backend |
| Community | 40% | DevRel (hire Q3) |
| Partnerships | 20% | Kalam, Thomas |

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should we do paid developer acquisition experiments?
- [ ] How to scale community without losing quality?
- [ ] What's the right partnership revenue split?
- [ ] When to invest in enterprise motion?
