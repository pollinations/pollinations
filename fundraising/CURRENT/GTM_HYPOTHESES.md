## Three Primary Hypotheses

### 1. Developer Community Flywheel (High Confidence)

**Bet**: Zero-friction API + open-source ethos drives organic growth at zero CAC.

**Evidence**:
- 600+ developers joining daily (organic)
- 17K Discord members
- 3.8K GitHub stars
- 1,000+ apps published (Discord bots, creative tools, games, web apps)
- Zero marketing spend to date

**App Distribution** (464 apps from APPS.md):
- Creative tools: 40%
- Chat apps: 24%
- Dev tools: 11%
- Games (incl. Roblox): 8%
- Learning: 6%
- Social bots: 5%
- Vibes: 5%

### 2. User-Pays Model (High Confidence)

**Bet**: We shift monetization from "developers paying infra" to "end-users paying per-use" inside apps.

**Important nuance**: Roblox is a strong *analog* for user-pays at scale, but in our Roblox examples users pay **Roblox**, not Pollinations.

**Evidence**:
- Roblox creator economy: $1B+ payouts in 2025 (shows user spend in creator platforms)
- Our ecosystem already has consumer-facing surfaces beyond games (Creative 40%, Chat 24%) where end-user pay is a natural fit

---

### 3. AI Model Provider Partnerships (Medium Confidence)

**Bet**: Providers sponsor placements for distribution to our dev base.

**Evidence**:
- Together AI offered $250K + $500K credits
- Model providers need distribution channels

## What We Don't Do (Yet)

- ❌ Paid acquisition
- ❌ Enterprise sales team
- ❌ Trade shows
