# 🏛️ Historical Investor Strategy (Antler & Outlier)

**Goal**: Leverage existing investors for momentum, bridge capital, and signaling.
**Status**: Critical / P0 (Influence on new round).

---

## 1. Antler (Current Investor)
**Status**: Invested in **Myceli GmbH** (Pre-Seed).
**Stake**: ~5.9% (needs verification).

### Strategy
1.  **The "First Believer" Signal**: We need Antler to commit to their pro-rata (or more) early. "Existing insiders are doubling down" is the strongest signal for new investors.
2.  **Bridge Option (Backstop)**: If the external Seed round takes >3 months, we may need a €300K-€500K bridge. Antler is the first call for this.
3.  **Network Access**: Use Antler's partner network for warm intros to **Tier 1 VCs** (Seedcamp, Cherry, LocalGlobe).

### Action Plan
- [ ] **Meeting**: Schedule update with Antler partner (Feb 5-10).
- [ ] **Ask**: "Are you reserving capital for follow-on in this round?"
- [ ] **Ask**: "Can you introduce us to [Specific Partner] at Seedcamp/Cherry?"
- [ ] **Verify**: Confirm exact terms of their existing SAFE (Cap/Discount) to ensure new terms are stepped up correctly.

## 2. Outlier Ventures (Previous Investor)
**Status**: Portfolio company (Pollinations listed).
**Context**: Need to re-engage. They invested in the previous iteration/vision.

### Strategy
1.  **Re-activation**: They may not be aware of the "Roblox for AI" pivot and current traction (3M MAU).
2.  **Web3/Token Angle**: If they still have a token mandate, clarify that Pollen *could* be on-chain in the future (optionality), but we are building a web2 business first.
3.  **Bridge Participation**: They might have "dry powder" for portfolio support.

### Action Plan
- [ ] **Update Email**: Send "Pollinations 2.0" update (similar to One Pager but highlighting the pivot success).
- [ ] **Check Rights**: Do they have MFN or pro-rata rights we need to honor?
- [ ] **Ask**: "We are opening a Seed round. Do you have allocation for follow-on?"

## 3. Bridge Round (Contingency)
**Trigger**: If cash runway < 4 months before Seed close.
**Target**: €300K - €500K.
**Structure**: Uncapped SAFE with 20% Discount (standard bridge terms).

**Allocations**:
1.  Antler: €100K
2.  Outlier: €100K
3.  Angels: €100K

> **Note**: Avoid a bridge if possible. It signals weakness. Only do it if it guarantees survival to a stronger Seed close.

---

## 4. Entity Cleanup (Myceli vs Pollinations)
**Risk**: Investors need clarity on what they are buying.
- **Current**: Antler is in Myceli GmbH.
- **New Round**: Will likely be in Myceli GmbH (operating as Pollinations).
- **Action**: Ensure all IP (Pollinations brand, code) is assigned to Myceli GmbH before due diligence.

## ✅ Summary Checklist
- [ ] Confirm Antler Pro-Rata interest.
- [ ] Re-engage Outlier Ventures with traction update.
- [ ] Verify IP assignment to Myceli GmbH.
