**Last Updated**: Feb 2, 2026

---

## 🏆 Tier 1: The "Perfect Fit" (High Priority)
*Thesis aligned with Pollinations: Dev Tools, Generative AI, or Open Source.*

| VC Firm | HQ | Why Them? (The Hook) | Key Partner | Relevant Portfolio | Action |
|---------|----|----------------------|-------------|--------------------|--------|
| **Point Nine** | Berlin | **The SaaS/DevTools Specialists.** They understand bottom-up adoption and "vibe coding" as the next B2B wave. | **Christoph Janz** or **Louis Coppey** | *Algolia, Contentful, Loom* | Warm intro via Antler/Founders |
| **Air Street** | London | **AI-First Specialists.** Nathan Benaich gets the technical nuance. They backed Black Forest Labs (Flux) - we are a distribution channel for Flux. | **Nathan Benaich** | *Black Forest Labs (Flux), Adept* | "We are the distribution layer for your models" |
| **Seedcamp** | London | **The Network Effect.** Strongest seed brand in Europe. They get "Community as Moat". | **Sia Houchangnia** (AI focus) | *Synthesia, UiPath, Hopin* | Apply via warm intro (deep Antler connections) |
| **OSS Capital** | Remote | **The Open Source Thesis.** Sole focus on commercial OSS. They believe "Open Source eats everything." | **Joseph Jacks (JJ)** | *Cal.com, Hoppscotch* | Pitch: "Commercializing Open Source AI Infra" |
| **Cherry Ventures**| Berlin | **Local + Consumer Tech.** Strong Berlin presence. Good fit for the "Gen Z Creator" angle. | **Jasper Masemann** (AI Thesis) | *FlixBus, Auto1* | "Roblox for AI" narrative |

## 🥈 Tier 2: Strong Generalist Seed Funds
*Deep pockets, good networks, looking for "Generation Defining" companies.*

| VC Firm | HQ | Angle | Notes |
|---------|----|-------|-------|
| **Speedinvest** | Vienna/Berlin | Network Effects | Very active in marketplaces/platforms. |
| **EQT Ventures** | Stockholm | "Motherbrain" (Data-driven) | They use AI to find deals; our metrics (GitHub stars, discord growth) will flag us. |
| **LocalGlobe** | London | Serial Seed Investors | High volume, fast decisions. |
| **Connect Ventures**| London | Product-Led Growth | Loves strong UX/Product founders. |
| **Creandum** | Stockholm | Consumer/Viral | Backed Spotify. They get the "Music/Art" roots of Pollinations. |

## 🥉 Tier 3: Strategic / Reach
*US-based or later stage, but worth a "shoot your shot".*

| VC Firm | HQ | Angle |
|---------|----|-------|
| **a16z (Consumer)**| SF | "Vibe Coding" thesis | (Justine Moore / Consumer partners). Hard to reach but huge signal. |
| **Sequoia (Arc)** | SF | Developer ecosystem | If they are scouting Europe. |
| **Kima Ventures** | Paris | High volume | "The most active angel-VC in the world". Good for filling the round. |

## 🏹 Outreach Strategy by Archetype

### Archetype A: The "Dev Tools" VC (Point Nine, Seedcamp)
*   **Subject Line**: "Pollinations.ai (Seed): The Roblox for AI / 600+ devs daily"
*   **The Hook**: "We are the infrastructure layer for the 'Vibe Coding' generation. 1,000 apps live, user-pays model piloting."
*   **Metrics Focus**: GitHub stars, Daily Active Developers, API usage growth.

### Archetype B: The "Gen Z / Consumer" VC (Cherry, Creandum, a16z)
*   **Subject Line**: "Pollinations.ai: 3M MAU AI ecosystem for Gen Z"
*   **The Hook**: "83% of Gen Z are creators. We give them the tools to build AI apps without credit cards. Viral organic growth."
*   **Metrics Focus**: MAU, Discord community size, Creator earnings (Roblox analog).

### Archetype C: The "AI Specialist" VC (Air Street)
*   **Subject Line**: "Pollinations.ai: Aggregation layer for open models (Flux/Llama)"
*   **The Hook**: "Models are commoditizing. Distribution is the bottleneck. We aggregate Flux/Llama for the long tail of developers."
*   **Metrics Focus**: Token consumption, model routing efficiency, cost structure.

## ⚠️ Anti-Portfolio (Check before reaching out)
*   **Check**: Do they own a major stake in **Replicate** or **FAL.ai**? (Direct competitors).
    *   *Note*: Air Street is in Black Forest Labs (Partner), not infrastructure competitor. Good sign.
    *   *Note*: Sequoia led FAL's round. (Might be blocked, or interested in consolidation).

## ✅ Next Steps
1.  **Enrich**: Add contact names (Partner level) for Tier 1.
2.  **Connections**: Map "Who knows who" (use LinkedIn/Antler network).
3.  **Batching**: Reach out to Tier 2 first to refine pitch, then Tier 1.
