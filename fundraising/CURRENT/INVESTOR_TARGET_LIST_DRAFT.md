## 🏹 Outreach Strategy by Archetype

### Archetype A: The "Dev Tools" VC (Point Nine, Seedcamp)
*   **Subject Line**: "Pollinations.ai (Seed): The Roblox for AI / 600+ devs daily"
*   **The Hook**: "We are the infrastructure layer for the 'Vibe Coding' generation. 1,000 apps live, user-pays model piloting."
*   **Metrics Focus**: GitHub stars, Daily Active Developers, API usage growth.

### Archetype B: The "Gen Z / Consumer" VC (Cherry, Creandum, a16z)
*   **Subject Line**: "Pollinations.ai: 3M MAU AI ecosystem for Gen Z"
*   **The Hook**: "83% of Gen Z are creators. We give them the tools to build AI apps without credit cards. Viral organic growth."
*   **Metrics Focus**: MAU, Discord community size, Creator earnings (Roblox analog).

### Archetype C: The "AI Specialist" VC (Air Street)
*   **Subject Line**: "Pollinations.ai: Aggregation layer for open models (Flux/Llama)"
*   **The Hook**: "Models are commoditizing. Distribution is the bottleneck. We aggregate Flux/Llama for the long tail of developers."
*   **Metrics Focus**: Token consumption, model routing efficiency, cost structure.

---

## ⚠️ Anti-Portfolio (Check before reaching out)
*   **Check**: Do they own a major stake in **Replicate** or **FAL.ai**? (Direct competitors).
    *   *Note*: Air Street is in Black Forest Labs (Partner), not infrastructure competitor. Good sign.
    *   *Note*: Sequoia led FAL's round. (Might be blocked, or interested in consolidation).

---

## ✅ Next Steps
1.  **Enrich**: Add contact names (Partner level) for Tier 1.
2.  **Connections**: Map "Who knows who" (use LinkedIn/Antler network).
3.  **Batching**: Reach out to Tier 2 first to refine pitch, then Tier 1.
