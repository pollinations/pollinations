> **⚠️ DRAFT - For Internal Review Only**

## 🎯 The Archetypes (Who we are looking for)

We are looking for a Lead Investor who fits one of these three specific archetypes. Do not waste time on "Generalist B2B SaaS" investors who want to see enterprise contracts today.

### Archetype A: The "Dev Tools" Native
*   **Thesis**: "Developers are the new kingmakers. Bottom-up adoption wins."
*   **What they love**: SDKs, APIs, Open Source, GitHub stars, Developer adoption graphs.
*   **Examples**: Point Nine (Christoph Janz), Boldstart, Heavybit, Seedcamp (Tom Wilson).
*   **The Pitch to them**: "We are the infrastructure layer for the next million developers."

### Archetype B: The "Gen Z Consumer" Believer
*   **Thesis**: "The next big social/creation platform will be AI-native."
*   **What they love**: Viral loops, huge MAU numbers, Discord activity, Creator Economy stats.
*   **Examples**: a16z Consumer (Justine Moore), Cherry Ventures (Consumer team), Creandum.
*   **The Pitch to them**: "We are the Roblox for AI. 83% of Gen Z are creators, and we give them the tools."

### Archetype C: The "AI Infrastructure" Specialist
*   **Thesis**: "Models are commoditizing; value accrues to the aggregation/distribution layer."
*   **What they love**: Routing efficiency, cost structures, model independence, technical moats.
*   **Examples**: Air Street Capital (Nathan Benaich), radical Ventures.
*   **The Pitch to them**: "We are the unified gateway for all models (Flux, Llama, etc.). We own the distribution."

## 🚩 Red Flags (Who to avoid)
*   **The "Enterprise Only" VC**: Asks "Where are your SOC2 compliance docs?" or "Who is your first Fortune 500 customer?" (Too early/wrong fit).
*   **The "Model Builders"**: Only invests in foundational models (building LLMs). We *use* models, we don't *train* foundational models from scratch.
*   **The "Conservative" Seed Fund**: Wants to see €50K MRR *sustained* for 12 months before investing. (We have traction, but monetization is just starting).

## 📋 Scouting Checklist (When qualifying a lead)
1.  **Do they have a thesis on "Generative AI Applications" or "Developer Tools"?**
2.  **Have they led a Seed round before?** (We need a *Lead* to price the round, not just followers).
3.  **Check Size**: Can they write a €1M - €1.5M check? (Lead typically takes 50-70% of the round).
4.  **Portfolio Conflict**: Do they own a major stake in **Replicate** or **FAL.ai**? (If yes, they might be blocked).

## 🗣️ Key Keywords to Look For
Look for VCs tweeting/writing about:
*   "Vibe Coding" / "Natural Language Programming"
*   "Vertical AI"
*   "Commercial Open Source (COSS)"
*   "Prosumer Tools"
*   "AI Agents"

**Action for Kalam**:
Use this profile to filter the long list of investors. If a VC doesn't fit Archetype A, B, or C, deprioritize them.
