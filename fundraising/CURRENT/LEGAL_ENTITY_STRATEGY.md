# ⚖️ Legal Entity Strategy: Myceli vs. Pollinations

**Goal**: Ensure a clean, investable structure for the Seed Round.
**Status**: Critical cleanup required before Due Diligence.

---

## 1. The Current Situation
*   **Active Entity**: **Myceli GmbH** (Germany).
*   **Brand**: **Pollinations.ai**.
*   **Legacy Entity**: Pollinations GmbH (Old entity, status unclear - assumed inactive/to be closed).
*   **Existing Investor**: Antler is on the cap table of **Myceli GmbH**.

## 2. The Clean-Up Strategy (Pre-Raise)

### A. IP Assignment (The "Red Flag" Killer)
Investors need to know that the company they invest in owns 100% of the Intellectual Property.
*   **Risk**: If code/IP sits with founders individually or the old entity, VC legal teams will block the deal.
*   **Action**: Execute a comprehensive **IP Transfer/Assignment Agreement**.
    *   **From**: Thomas Haferlach (Founder) & Old Pollinations GmbH.
    *   **To**: Myceli GmbH.
    *   **Scope**: All code, domains (pollinations.ai), trademarks, and brand assets.

### B. Branding vs. Legal Name
*   **Recommendation**: Keep legal name as **Myceli GmbH** for now (renaming is slow/expensive in Germany).
*   **DBA (Doing Business As)**: Operate strictly as **Pollinations** in all decks and contracts.
*   **Clause**: Include a "Name Change" clause in the shareholder agreement if investors insist on matching names (usually not a dealbreaker).

### C. Old Entity (Legacy Pollinations GmbH)
*   **Action**: Ensure it is formally dormant or in liquidation.
*   **Liability**: Confirm no outstanding debts or liabilities that could bleed over.
*   **Clean Break**: Ensure absolutely no IP license *back* to the old entity.

## 3. Cap Table & Myceli GmbH
*   **Current Cap Table**: Founders + Antler.
*   **New Round**: Will issue new shares (or SAFE conversion rights) in Myceli GmbH.
*   **ESOP (VSOP)**: German startups typically use **Virtual Share Option Plans (VSOP)**.
    *   **Action**: Establish a ~10-15% VSOP pool *before* or *during* the round.
    *   **Why**: Investors want to see an option pool available for key hires (e.g., Senior Engineers).

## 4. Deal Structure (German Specifics)
*   **SAFE Note**: Not natively recognized in German law (GmbH shares require notary).
*   **Workaround**: Use a **Wandeldarlehen (Convertible Loan)** structured to *mimic* a YC SAFE.
    *   **Key Clauses**:
        *   **Valuation Cap**: €10M-€12M.
        *   **Discount**: 20%.
        *   **Qualifying Event**: Equity round >€X.
        *   **Maturity Date**: 18-24 months (backstop conversion).
*   **US Investors**: If raising from US VCs, they may push for a "Flip" (Delaware C-Corp).
    *   **Defense**: "We are a German GmbH. We can do a flip later if needed for Series A, but for Seed, we stay German to keep costs low."
