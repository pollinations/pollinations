# 🌸 Pollinations.ai | Seed Round One Pager

**The simplest compute layer for the AI generation.**  
*Infrastructure for the "Vibe Coding" Era.*

---

## 📉 The Problem
**AI creation is gatekept by complexity and credit cards.**
A new generation of millions of "vibe coders" (teens, indie devs, creators) wants to build AI apps, but they face three walls:
1.  **Fragmentation**: Managing API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Replicate is a mess.
2.  **Financial Barrier**: Most APIs require a credit card upfront. A 16-year-old in Brazil can't even start.
3.  **Isolation**: No community support or path to "level up" their reputation.

## 🚀 The Solution
**One API. Free to start. A community that pays you back.**
Pollinations is the unified API gateway that aggregates open-source and proprietary models into a single, permissionless interface.
*   **Zero Friction**: No signup, no API keys, one line of code to generate images/text.
*   **User-Pays Model**: We are shifting the cost from developers to end-users (pilot live).
*   **Pollen Economy**: A gamified rewards system where GitHub contributions earn compute credits.

## ⚡ Traction (Organic)
We spend **$0** on marketing. Our growth is fueled by an open-source flywheel.
*   **600+** new developers joining *daily*
*   **3M+** Monthly Active Users (MAU) across the ecosystem
*   **1,000+** live apps (Chatbots, Creative Tools, Games)
*   **17K+** Discord members (Real-time support & co-creation)
*   **$1B+** market analog (Roblox) validates the "creator economy" thesis

## 💰 Business Model
**1. Developer Top-Ups (Live)**: B2B credit purchases for power users.  
**2. User-Pays (Piloting)**: End-users pay micropayments (Pollen) inside apps for premium features. Pilot apps like *Pictify* and *PolliVision* are already testing this.  
**3. Partnerships**: Model providers (e.g., Together AI) sponsor credits to get distribution.

**Unit Economics**:
*   **Gross Margin**: Target 75%
*   **CAC**: ~$0 (Community-led growth)

## 🌍 Market & Vision
We are building **"Roblox for AI"**.
Just as Roblox democratized game creation for kids, Pollinations democratizes AI app creation.
*   **Gen Z Creators**: 83% of Gen Z identify as creators.
*   **Market Gap**: Enterprise infra (FAL, Replicate) ignores the long tail of indie creators. We own this segment.

## 💸 The Ask
**Raising €1.5M - €2.5M Seed Round**
*   **Runway**: 24+ months
*   **Milestones**: Launch User-Pays at scale, reach 150K active devs, break even.
