# 🌸 Pollinations.ai | Seed Round One Pager

> **⚠️ DRAFT v1 - For Internal Review Only**

**The simplest compute layer for AI-powered apps.**  
*One API. Free to start. Community that levels up with you.*

---

## 📉 The Problem
**AI is everywhere. Technical moats are disappearing. Everyone can build apps now.**

But the ecosystem is messy and isolating:
1.  **API Fragmentation**: Each provider has different APIs, keys, billing. Managing OpenAI + Anthropic + Replicate is a mess.
2.  **Credit Card Barrier**: A 16-year-old in Brazil or Indonesia can't even start. Most APIs require payment upfront.
3.  **Financial Risk**: App goes viral → massive unexpected bill. No cost controls.
4.  **No Support System**: You're alone with docs and YouTube. No community, no path to level up.

## 🚀 The Solution
**One API. Free to start. A community that levels up with you.**

Pollinations is the unified API gateway that aggregates open-source and proprietary models into a single, permissionless interface.

*   **Zero Friction**: No signup, no API keys, one line of code to generate images/text.
*   **User-Pays Model**: Shifting cost from developers to end-users. Pilot apps already live.
*   **Pollen Economy**: Gamified rewards where contributions earn compute credits.
*   **Community Pipeline**: End User → App Modifier → Publisher → Community Leader → Core Contributor

## ⚡ Traction (Organic)
We spend **$0** on marketing. Our growth is fueled by an open-source flywheel.
*   **600+** new developers joining *daily*
*   **3M+** Monthly Active Users (MAU) across the ecosystem
*   **1,000+** live apps (Chatbots, Creative Tools, Games)
*   **17K+** Discord members (Real-time support & co-creation)
*   **$1B+** market analog (Roblox) validates the "creator economy" thesis

## 💰 Business Model: B2B2C Creator Platform

**We're a creator platform** - we serve creators who serve end-users. Similar to:
- **TikTok/YouTube**: Creators make content, platform monetizes
- **Twitch**: Streamers build audiences, viewers pay via subs
- **Unity/Unreal**: Game devs build games, players pay inside games

| Revenue Stream | Description | Status |
|----------------|-------------|--------|
| **1. Developer Top-Ups (B2B)** | Devs buy credits to power AI features. $1 = 5000 images. | ✅ Live (~$6K/mo) |
| **2. User-Pays (B2C via B2B)** | End-users pay for AI usage inside apps. We take 4% GMV. | 🟡 Mar 2026 |
| **3. Model Partnerships** | AI providers sponsor credits for distribution. | 🔄 Active |

**Why This Matters**: We flip the infrastructure model. Instead of devs paying for users, users pay for themselves. Our creators range from teens making viral chatbots to small studios building commercial apps.

**Unit Economics**:
*   **Gross Margin**: Target 75%
*   **CAC**: ~$0 (Community-led growth)
*   **Pricing**: $1 = 5,000 images (no subscriptions, no minimums)

## 🌍 Market & Vision
**We are building "Roblox for AI".**

Just as Roblox democratized game creation for kids, Pollinations democratizes AI app creation.
*   **Gen Z Creators**: 83% of Gen Z identify as creators.
*   **Market Gap**: Enterprise infra ignores the long tail of indie creators. We own this segment.
*   **End State**: Mycelial network of millions of AI micro-apps with sustainable unit economics.

**Position**: Not a foundational model company — the open access layer. Permissionless. Interoperable. Community-run.

## 💸 The Ask
**Raising €1.5M - €2.5M Seed Round**
*   **Valuation**: ~€12M pre-money (17-22% dilution)
*   **Runway**: 24+ months
*   **Milestones**: Launch User-Pays at scale, reach 150K active devs, break even.
