# 📊 Pollinations Seed Pitch Deck Structure (10 Slides)

**Theme**: "The Roblox for AI"
**Goal**: Raise €1.5M-€2.5M
**Audience**: Seed Investors (Antler, Angels, Pre-Seed VCs)

---

## Slide 1: Title
- **Headline**: Pollinations.ai
- **Subhead**: The simplest compute layer for the AI generation.
- **Visual**: A cool, generative background (created by Pollinations).
- **One-liner**: Infrastructure for the "Vibe Coding" Era.

## Slide 2: The Problem (Barriers)
- **Headline**: The next million AI creators are locked out.
- **Bullets**:
  1.  **Financial Barrier**: Teens & global devs don't have credit cards (16yo in Brazil).
  2.  **Fragmented APIs**: Managing keys for OpenAI, Claude, Replicate is messy.
  3.  **No Path to Revenue**: Indie apps go viral, bills explode, no way to monetize.
- **Visual**: Screenshot of a "Credit Card Required" modal vs. a rejected card.

## Slide 3: The Solution (The Gateway)
- **Headline**: One API. Free to start. Community-powered.
- **Three Pillars**:
  1.  **Zero Friction**: No signup, no keys. One line of code.
  2.  **Unified Access**: Aggregates all top models (OpenAI, Flux, Llama, etc.).
  3.  **Pollen Economy**: Gamified credits system (GitHub commits = Compute).
- **Visual**: Code snippet comparison: "Theirs (20 lines + API key)" vs "Ours (1 line)".

## Slide 4: Traction (Organic Flywheel)
- **Headline**: Zero marketing spend. Viral organic growth.
- **Key Metrics**:
  - **600+** New devs/day
  - **3M+** Monthly Active Users
  - **1,000+** Live Apps
  - **17K+** Discord Members
- **Visual**: Graph showing developer signup growth (hockey stick).

## Slide 5: The "User-Pays" Model (Secret Sauce)
- **Headline**: Flipping the economics of AI infrastructure.
- **Concept**: Instead of developers paying for infra, end-users pay for premium features (micropayments).
- **Proof**:
  - **Analog**: Roblox ($1B+ creator payouts).
  - **Pilots**: *Pictify* (Creative), *PolliVision* (Video) already testing End-User Pollen.
- **Visual**: Diagram showing flow: User pays App -> App pays Pollinations -> Pollinations pays Model Provider.

## Slide 6: Market & Why Now
- **Headline**: Capturing the "Vibe Coding" Generation.
- **Why Now**:
  - **83%** of Gen Z are creators.
  - **Commoditization**: Models are cheap; *distribution* is the bottleneck.
  - **Market Gap**: Enterprise infra (FAL, Replicate) ignores the long tail. We own it.
- **Visual**: Pyramid showing "Enterprise" (top, crowded) vs "Long Tail/Indie" (bottom, huge, owning it).

## Slide 7: Business Model
- **Headline**: Multiple revenue streams.
- **1. Dev Top-Ups (Live)**: Power users buy bulk credits (~30% of rev).
- **2. End-User Pollen (Growth)**: The Roblox model. We take a % of every transaction (~60% of rev).
- **3. Sponsorships**: Model providers pay for distribution (~10% of rev).
- **Unit Economics**: 75% Gross Margin target. $0 CAC.

## Slide 8: Competition
- **Headline**: The only platform for the indie creator economy.
- **Matrix**:
  - **X-Axis**: Enterprise Focus vs. Indie/Creator Focus
  - **Y-Axis**: Infrastructure (Raw API) vs. Ecosystem (Community/Economy)
  - **Position**: Pollinations is top-right (Indie + Ecosystem).
  - **Competitors**: FAL/Replicate (Enterprise Infra), OpenRouter (Raw Aggregator).

## Slide 9: The Ask & Milestones
- **Headline**: Raising €1.5M - €2.5M Seed Round.
- **Runway**: 24 months.
- **Milestones to Series A**:
  1.  **Scale User-Pays**: Prove the model with 3-5 major apps.
  2.  **150K Developers**: Dominate the indie segment.
  3.  **Break Even**: Path to profitability via high-margin Pollen economy.

## Slide 10: Team
- **Thomas Haferlach (CEO)**: Ex-Amazon AI, Neural Networks Researcher.
- **Elliot (COO)**: [Bio].
- **Kalam (Growth)**: [Bio].
- **Footer**: "We built the platform we wished we had at 16."
