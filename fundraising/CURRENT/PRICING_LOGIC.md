## Business Model: B2B2C Creator Platform

We're a **creator platform** - we serve creators who serve end-users. Similar to:
- **TikTok/YouTube**: Creators make content, platform monetizes
- **Twitch**: Streamers build audiences, viewers pay via subs
- **Unity/Unreal**: Game devs build games, players pay inside games

Our creators range from teens making viral AI chatbots to small studios building commercial apps.

## Core Model

- **Product**: AI services (image, text, audio, video)
- **Unit**: Pollen credits (prepaid, per-use, USD-denominated)
- **Philosophy (target)**: User-pays - end-users cover their own AI usage inside apps
- **Today (B2B)**: Developer-paid top-ups (~$6K/month)
- **March 2026 (B2C via B2B)**: End-users buy Pollen directly inside apps

## Pricing Principles (from Notion)

1. **Under-market pricing** - Below consumer rates via partnerships
2. **Prices only go down** - Scheduled reviews, reductions only
3. **Model buckets** - Groups smooth provider price swings
4. **No surprise charges** - Free allocations drive adoption

## Revenue Streams

| Stream | Current | Mechanism |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Dev Top-Ups** | ~$6K/mo | B2B credit purchases |
| **End-User Pollen** | Planned (Mar 2026) | User-pays via apps |
| **Ads/Sponsorship** | Exploring | Model provider placements |

## Take Rates (from Financial Model)

- **Pollen GMV**: 4% (payment processing)
- **Ads Revenue**: 15% (network fee)

## Cost Structure

- **Current COGS**: ~€40K/mo (fixed, pre-monetization)
- **Target COGS**: 25% of revenue (post-monetization)
- **Target Gross Margin**: 75%

## Open Questions

- [ ] Verify exact Pollen-to-$ conversion rates
- [ ] Finalize video pricing (currently gated)
- [ ] A/B test price sensitivity
