## **POLLINATIONS**

The open-source AI platform for creators.
Community-driven. 1,000+ apps live. 3M+ users/month.

---

## The Problem

**Millions of builders. No infrastructure that fits.**

Every week, a new wave of developers ships AI-powered apps — Discord bots, browser tools, game mods, image generators, creative instruments.

They're not startups. They don't have backend teams.
They build with prompts, ship on GitHub, and find users overnight.

But the moment an app gets traction, they hit a wall:
API keys they can't afford. Billing systems they can't build. Costs they can't predict.

*"What if my app takes off and I can't afford the bill?"*

And users? They won't pay for 10 separate AI subscriptions. Subscription hell.

That fear kills more AI apps than bad code.

## Why Now

**Natural language is the new programming.** "Vibe coding" is Collins Word of the Year 2025.

A new creator space is emerging — indie developers, hackers, students, gamers — shipping real products on Discord, Reddit, and GitHub. Models are commodity. **Distribution wins.**

Cloud aggregators focus on startups and enterprise. These **creators** don't fit that mold. Pollinations is the open platform made for them.

## Team

**Thomas Haferlach — CEO**
Amazon AI. Published neural networks researcher. Edinburgh AI top of class.
9 years building creative tech communities in Brazil and Berlin.

*"I built this because I needed it at 16. No credit card, no access — so the next generation doesn't face those barriers."*

**Elliot Fouchy — CPO**
Full-stack engineer. Infrastructure at scale. Shipped and runs the entire backend from day one.

*"I keep it running so builders can keep building."*

## Pollen

**One currency for all AI apps.**

**1 Pollen = $1.** One credit, one wallet, every AI app.

Developers add Pollen with one API call. Users buy Pollen once — spend it across 1,000+ apps. No API keys. No backend. No billing code. Just build.

**Think of it like electricity.** We power the apps. Users pay for the electricity. Creators share the revenue.

Developer builds free → Users buy Pollen inside the app → We take a cut, developer gets the rest

**Developers are our distribution.** Every app is a storefront we didn't have to build. Creators earn on every Pollen spent inside their app — and can cash out to their bank account.

---

## Traction

**Zero marketing. All organic.**

| **3M+** | end-users/month (across developer apps) |
| --- | --- |
| **1,000+** | live apps |
| **600+** | new devs/day |
| **17K+** | Discord members |
| **3.9K** | GitHub stars |

We're growing because we're the easiest way to build.

## Competitors

**We sell THROUGH developers, not TO them.**

|  | HuggingFace | fal.ai | OpenRouter | Us |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Core role | Model hub | API provider | LLM aggregator | Distribution layer |
| Customer | Researchers | Enterprise | Devs-Startups | Creators |
| Entry | Use models | Pay-per-use API | API key | No signup needed |
| Revenue | Enterprise | Contracts | Usage fees | End users buy Pollen |

Fal ($4.5B) and OpenRouter ($500M, ~8 people) charge developers. **We go further — end users pay, not developers.** The developer isn't our customer — the developer is our distribution channel.

**The moat:** 17K Discord community onboards new devs, handles support, and ships starter kits. Zero support cost. Switching means breaking live products.

Stripe started with side projects. Firebase started with hobbyists. We're already inside 1,000+ products.

---

## Business Model

**Revenue scales with end users, not developer headcount.**

Users buy Pollen once and spend it everywhere.
More apps = more reasons to buy. More users = more revenue per app.

**Proof:**
One creator-built gaming app: 51M visits. $12K/month in user spend.

*That's the flywheel.* Millions of creators, a unified wallet, and users paying inside experiences.

## The Ask

Power the long tail of AI apps.

**Raise: €2.5M Seed**
50% Compute-Infrastructure · 30% Engineering · 20% Community

**Milestones:**
- Q1: In-app payments live — users buy Pollen inside any creator app
- Q2: Creator rev-share — devs earn on every Pollen spent in their apps
- Q3: App discovery + curation — become the go-to place for AI apps

We're already inside 1,000+ products.
