# POLLINATIONS PITCH DECK — PUNCHY VERSION

*Bold, memorable, cuts to the chase*

---

## **POLLINATIONS**

Developers build free. Users pay.
Every app, a storefront.
We have 1000+ today, reaching millions of users.

# The New Builders are Creators

"creators", devs, startups, enterprise

Apps are now built with prompts. AI features are everywhere.
New creator space emerging—indie developers, hackers, students, gamers—making apps for the next billion users.
It's creative and messy—AI experiments to deployment. Cloud aggregators focus on startups and enterprise with stable revenue. These **creators** don't fit that mold.

Pollinations is an open platform made for these **creators** by technical founders who have shipped AI products and grown creative tech communities—we live and breathe this space.

# Team

**Creators, Technical Founders, Who Ship**

**Thomas Haferlach — CEO**
Amazon AI. Published neural networks researcher. Edinburgh AI top of class.
Built this because he needed it at 16.

"*As a teenager without a credit card, I hacked my way into apps. I've been building AI-native products ever since — so the next generation of devs don't face those hurdles"*

**Elliot Fouchy — CPO**
Full-stack. Infra at scale. Makes it run.

"*Learning resilience as an engineer on a remote island, I channel that grit to lead ops, ship infra, and keep Pollinations moving forward."*

---

## The Gap

**Enterprise AI is complex. API keys, backend setup, billing infrastructure.**

**Consumer tools (Flora): Polished UX but no path to production. No APIs.**

Creators who ship real products can't fund the experimentation phase.
The fear: "What if my app takes off and I can't afford the bill?"

Creators don't want complexity. They want to build the **fun** part.

400+ developers join us every day. $0 spent on sales.

That's the gap.

---

## Why Now

**Natural language is the new programming.**

- "Vibe coding" is Collins Word of the Year 2025 — natural language replaces programming
- Meta's Alexandr Wang: "If you're 13, spend all your time vibe coding" — the next Bill Gates is a teenager
- Teenagers, indie devs, and small teams are shipping real products on Discord, Roblox, and GitHub
- Models are commoditizing — value is shifting to distribution and orchestration

**Technical moats are gone. Distribution wins.**

# Pollen - Compute for the next billion consumers of AI apps

Today's AI app experiences require logins and payment setups per app—great for enterprise, but fragmented for consumers.

Our infra is purpose built for unified authentication, AI model access and compute billing as a service with **Pollen credits:**

**1 Pollen = $1 -** It is designed for an emergent economy of AI apps with billions of users, and multi-modal compute.

**Developers integrate Pollen into their apps.**

**Users buy pollen to unlock AI features.**

**Pollen is the simplest way for builders to scale AI features in their apps to millions.**

---

## How It Works

**The Distribution Layer for Generative AI**

One API call. Any AI model. No setup.

**The Graduation Path:**
Developer gets Pollen → Builds app → App goes live → End users buy Pollen → Revenue flows

No API keys. No backend. No billing integration. Just build.

**For end users today: One wallet. 1,000 AI apps. Buy Pollen once, use it everywhere.**

**Developers are our distribution.**
Every app they ship is a revenue channel we didn't build.

---

# **The Network Effect - 1000s today to millions of apps powered by Pollen.**

A user might use 10 different AI apps and never visit our website directly - they benefit from having one account and one Pollen balance that works across all of them.

- **For Developers:** Our infrastructure removes all friction from building AI-powered apps. No backends, no API key management, no billing code. Plus, join a community of builders and get direct access to your user base.
- **For Users:** One account, one pollen balance across every AI app you use. Daily free credits, full control over spending and model preferences. Create an account once, use it everywhere.

**Think of Pollen like:**

- **Stripe** for payments → but for AI credits
- **Auth0** for authentication → but with built-in AI usage consent
- **OpenRouter** for AI routing → but user centric, they get to choose which model they pay for

## Traction

**Zero marketing. All organic.**

| **3M+** | end-users/month (across developer apps) |
| --- | --- |
| **1,000+** | live apps |
| **400+** | new devs/day |
| **17K+** | Discord members |
| **3.9K** | GitHub stars |

We're growing because we're the easiest way to build.

---

## Why We Win

**We sell THROUGH developers, not TO them.**

Fal ($4.5B valuation, $200M+ ARR) and OpenRouter ($40M raised from a16z + Sequoia, $500M valuation, ~8 people) charge developers.

**They validate the model. We go further — end users pay, not developers.**

**We let developers build free.**
Then we monetize the end users they bring.

1,000+ apps = 1,000+ acquisition channels we didn't pay for.

**Two sides, one economy**

For developers: free infrastructure, zero setup.
For end users: one account, 1,000+ AI apps, one balance. The App Store of AI.

---

## The Moat

**Community that compounds.**

17K Discord members + bots
- Answering questions
- Shipping starter kits
- Onboarding new devs

**Zero support cost at scale.**

Switching means breaking live products.

---

## Business Model

**Revenue Scales With End Users, Not Developer Headcount**

**Two customers. One economy.**

Dev builds free → App launches → Users buy Pollen → We collect revenue.

Users don't buy per app. They buy Pollen once and spend it everywhere.
More apps = more reasons to buy. More users = more revenue per app.

**Proof:**
Roblox game. 51M visits. $12K/month revenue.
Pays us $500/month.

*That's the flywheel.* Millions of creators, a unified wallet, and users paying inside experiences.

We're bringing that model to *all* AI apps.

---

## Slide 9: Competitors

**They sell to developers. We sell through them.**

|  | HuggingFace | fal.ai | OpenRouter | Us |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Core role | Model hub | API provider | LLM aggregator | Distribution layer |
| Customer | Researchers | Enterprise | Devs-Startups | Creators |
| Entry | Use models | Pay-per-use API | API key | No signup needed |
| Revenue | Enterprise | Contracts | Usage fees | End users buy Pollen |

OpenRouter ($40M from a16z + Sequoia, $500M valuation) proved unified AI APIs are a category. They charge developers 5% on inference. We let developers build free and monetize end users. AI model aggregation is settled. The question is who captures the consumer.

---

## **"Indie platforms ~~don't~~ work."**

Neither did:
- Stripe (side projects → $70B+ company)
- Firebase (hobbyists → acquired by Google)

Until they were inside the products that won.

**We serve creators. Their users pay. Teens today are the next wave of entrepreneurs — we need to be inside the ones that succeed.**

A thousand seeds. We only need a few to bloom.

---

## How big?

**The Long Tail of AI Products**

- 50M+ indie builders globally shipping apps, games, bots, and tools
- Millions of AI-native products will exist — we have 1000+ and growing
- Each product brings users; users bring spend
- Consumer AI spend is shifting from single apps → embedded experiences

**How much are people spending on AI?**

- **$50–100B** consumer AI usage spend (long tail growth)
- We monetize end users, not developers.
- Distribution compounds with every app shipped.
- We sit *inside* the products that win

---

## Slide 12: Vision and Ask

**Vision:** **Power the long tail of AI apps.** Become the default AI infrastructure for AI-native developers.

**Raise: €2.5M Seed**

50% — Compute-Infrastructure
30% — Engineering
20% — Community

---

## Slide 13: One Sentence

**We're the Stripe of generative AI.**

Developers build.
Users pay.
We're already inside 1,000+ products.
