# POLLINATIONS PITCH DECK — PUNCHY VERSION

*Bold, memorable, cuts to the chase*

## **POLLINATIONS**

Developers build free. Users pay.
Every app, a storefront.
We have 1000+ today, reaching millions of users.

# The New Creators

Apps are now built with prompts. AI is the new electricity.
A new creator space is emerging — indie developers, hackers, students, gamers — making apps for the next billion users.
Cloud aggregators focus on startups and enterprise. These **creators** don't fit that mold.

Pollinations is the open platform made for them.

---

## Problem → Solution

**Enterprise AI is complex. API keys, backend setup, billing infrastructure.**

Creators who ship real products can't fund the experimentation phase.
The fear: "What if my app takes off and I can't afford the bill?"
Creators don't want complexity. They want to build the **fun** part.

**Our answer: Pollen.**

**1 Pollen = $1.** One credit, one wallet, every AI app.

Developers integrate Pollen into their apps. Users buy Pollen to unlock AI features. No per-app logins, no per-app billing. Just build.

---

## How It Works

**The Distribution Layer for Generative AI**

One API call. Any AI model. No setup.

Developer gets Pollen → Builds app → App goes live → End users buy Pollen → Revenue flows

**For Developers:** Zero friction. No backends, no API key management, no billing code. Every app they ship is a revenue channel we didn't build.

**For Users:** One account, one Pollen balance across every AI app. Buy once, use everywhere. A user might use 10 AI apps and never visit our website — but they all run on Pollen.

**Think of Pollen like:**
- **Stripe** for payments → but for AI credits
- **Auth0** for authentication → but with built-in AI usage consent
- **OpenRouter** for AI routing → but user centric, they choose which model they pay for

## Why Now

**Natural language is the new programming.**

- "Vibe coding" is Collins Word of the Year 2025 — natural language replaces programming
- Meta's Alexandr Wang: "If you're 13, spend all your time vibe coding" — the next Bill Gates is a teenager
- Teenagers, indie devs, and small teams are shipping real products
- Models are commodity — value is shifting to distribution and orchestration

**Technical moats are gone. Distribution wins.**

## Traction

**Zero marketing. All organic.**

| **3M+** | end-users/month (across developer apps) |
| --- | --- |
| **1,000+** | live apps |
| **400+** | new devs/day |
| **17K+** | Discord members |
| **3.9K** | GitHub stars |

We're growing because we're the easiest way to build.

---

## Competitors

**We sell THROUGH developers, not TO them.**

|  | HuggingFace | fal.ai | OpenRouter | Us |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Core role | Model hub | API provider | LLM aggregator | Distribution layer |
| Customer | Researchers | Enterprise | Devs-Startups | Creators |
| Entry | Use models | Pay-per-use API | API key | No signup needed |
| Revenue | Enterprise | Contracts | Usage fees | End users buy Pollen |

Fal ($4.5B valuation) and OpenRouter ($40M from a16z + Sequoia, $500M valuation, ~8 people) charge developers. **We go further — end users pay, not developers.**

**The moat:** 17K Discord community onboards new devs for us. Zero support cost. Switching means breaking live products.

Stripe started with side projects. Firebase started with hobbyists. We're already inside 1,000+ products. A thousand seeds. We only need a few to bloom.

---

## Business Model

**50M+ indie builders globally. $50–100B in consumer AI spend. Revenue scales with end users, not developer headcount.**

**Two customers. One economy.**

Users don't buy per app. They buy Pollen once and spend it everywhere.
More apps = more reasons to buy. More users = more revenue per app.

**Proof:**
Roblox game. 51M visits. $12K/month revenue.
Pays us $500/month.

*That's the flywheel.* Millions of creators, a unified wallet, and users paying inside experiences.

We're bringing that model to *all* AI apps.

# Team

**Creators, Technical Founders, Who Ship**

**Thomas Haferlach — CEO**
Amazon AI. Published neural networks researcher. Edinburgh AI top of class.
Built this because he needed it at 16.

"*As a teenager without a credit card, I hacked my way into apps. I've been building AI-native products ever since — so the next generation of devs don't face those hurdles"*

**Elliot Fouchy — CPO**
Full-stack. Infra at scale. Makes it run.

"*Learning resilience as an engineer on a remote island, I channel that grit to lead ops, ship infra, and keep Pollinations moving forward."*
