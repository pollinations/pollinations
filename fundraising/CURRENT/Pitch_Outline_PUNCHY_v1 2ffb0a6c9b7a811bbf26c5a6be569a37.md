# POLLINATIONS PITCH DECK — PUNCHY VERSION

*Bold, memorable, cuts to the chase*

---

## Slide 1: Title

**POLLINATIONS**

Developers build free.
End users pay.
Every app is a storefront.
We have 800+.

---

## Slide 2: The Gap

**Enterprise AI is too expensive to start.Consumer AI has no APIs.**

600 developers join us every day.
$0 spent on sales.

That’s the gap.

---

## Slide 3: Why Now

**Natural language is the new programming.**

- “Vibe coders” — teenagers, indie devs, small teams — are building real products
- This doesn’t show up in enterprise sales reports
- It lives on Discord, Roblox, GitHub
- Youngest developer on our platform: 11 years old

**Technical moats are gone. Distribution wins.**

---

## Slide 4: How It Works

**Two pools. One insight.**

| BUILD | PRODUCTION |
| --- | --- |
| Free AI for devs | End users pay |
| No credit card | Premium models |
| No friction | Revenue flows through us |

**Developers are our distribution.**
Every app they ship is a revenue channel we didn’t build.

---

## Slide 5: Traction

**Zero marketing. All organic.**

| **3M+** | end-users/month |
| --- | --- |
| **800+** | live apps |
| **600+** | new devs/day |
| **17K+** | Discord members |

We’re growing because we’re the easiest way to build.

---

## Slide 6: Why We Win

**We sell THROUGH developers, not TO them.**

Fal charges developers.
Replicate charges developers.
OpenRouter charges developers.

**We let developers build free.**
Then we monetize the end users they bring.

800+ apps = 800+ acquisition channels we didn’t pay for.

---

## Slide 7: The Moat

**Community that compounds.**

17K Discord members + bots
- Answering questions
- Shipping starter kits
- Onboarding new devs

**Zero support cost at scale.**

Switching means breaking live products.

---

## Slide 8: Business Model

**One line.**

Dev builds free → App launches → Users buy Pollen → We collect revenue.

**Proof:**
Roblox game. 51M visits. $12K/month revenue.
Pays us $500/month.

*That’s the model.*

---

## Slide 9: Competitors

**They sell to developers. We sell through them.**

|  | HuggingFace | fal.ai | Us |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Customer | Researchers | Enterprise | Builders |
| Entry | Upload models | Sales call | One line of code |
| Revenue | Enterprise | Contracts | End users |

---

## Slide 10: The Counter

**“Indie platforms don’t work.”**

Neither did:
- Stripe (side projects)
- AWS (startups)
- Firebase (hobbyists)

Until they were inside the products that won.

**We don’t need every builder to succeed.We need to be inside the ones that do.**

---

## Slide 11: Team

**Builders.**

**Thomas Haferlach — CEO**
Amazon AI. Published researcher. Edinburgh top of class.
Built this because he needed it at 16.

**Elliot Fouchy — CPO**
Full-stack. Infra at scale. Makes it run.

---

## Slide 12: The Ask

**€2.5M Seed**
18–24 months runway.

50% — Engineering
30% — Compute
20% — Community

---

## Slide 13: One Sentence

**We’re the Stripe of generative AI.**

Developers build.
Users pay.
We’re already inside 800+ products.
