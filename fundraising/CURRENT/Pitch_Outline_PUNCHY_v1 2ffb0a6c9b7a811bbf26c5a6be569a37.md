# POLLINATIONS PITCH DECK — PUNCHY VERSION

*Bold, memorable, cuts to the chase*

---

## Slide 1: Title

**POLLINATIONS**

Developers build free.
End users pay.
Every app is a storefront.
1,000+ and growing — 20+ new apps per day.

---

## Slide 2: The Gap

**Enterprise AI requires API keys, backends, and billing infrastructure.
Consumer AI has no path to production.**

Creators don't want complexity. They want to build the fun part.
400+ developers join us every day. $0 spent on sales.

That's the gap.

---

## Slide 3: Why Now

**Natural language is the new programming.**

- "Vibe coding" is Collins Word of the Year 2025 — natural language replaces programming
- Meta's Alexandr Wang: "If you're 13, spend all your time vibe coding"
- Teenagers, indie devs, small teams are shipping real products on Discord, Roblox, GitHub
- We're the platform where that 13-year-old builds

**Technical moats are gone. Distribution wins.**

---

## Slide 4: How It Works

**Build free. Launch. Get paid.**

```
Developer gets credits → Builds app → App goes live → End users buy Pollen → Revenue flows
```

No API keys. No backend. No billing integration. Just build.

**For end users:** One wallet. 1,000 AI apps. Buy Pollen once, use it everywhere.

**Developers are our distribution.**
Every app they ship is a revenue channel we didn't build.

---

## Slide 5: Traction

**Zero marketing. All organic.**

| **3M+** | end-users/month (across developer apps) |
| --- | --- |
| **1,000+** | live apps |
| **400+** | new devs/day |
| **17K+** | Discord members |
| **3.9K** | GitHub stars |

We're growing because we're the easiest way to build.

---

## Slide 6: Why We Win

**We sell THROUGH developers, not TO them.**

Fal charges developers. ($4.5B valuation, $200M+ ARR)
OpenRouter charges developers. ($100M+ ARR, 5-person team, 1M+ devs)

**We let developers build free.**
Then we monetize the end users they bring.

They validate the model. We go further — end users pay, not developers.

---

## Slide 7: The Moat

**Community that compounds.**

17K Discord members + bots
- Answering questions
- Shipping starter kits
- Onboarding new devs

**Zero support cost at scale.**

Switching means breaking live products.

---

## Slide 8: Business Model

**One line.**

Dev builds free → App launches → Users buy Pollen → We collect revenue.

**Proof:**
Roblox game. 51M visits. $12K/month revenue.
Pays us $500/month.

*That’s the model.*

---

## Slide 9: Competitors

**They sell to developers. We sell through them.**

|  | HuggingFace | fal.ai | OpenRouter | Us |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Customer | Researchers | Enterprise | Developers | Creators |
| Entry | Use models | Pay-per-use API | API key | No signup needed |
| Revenue | Enterprise tooling | Contracts + GPU | Usage fees | End users buy Pollen |

---

## Slide 10: The Counter

**“Indie platforms don’t work.”**

Neither did:
- Stripe (side projects)
- AWS (startups)
- Firebase (hobbyists)

Until they were inside the products that won.

**A thousand seeds. We only need a few to bloom.**

---

## Slide 11: Team

**Builders.**

**Thomas Haferlach — CEO**
Amazon AI. Published researcher. Edinburgh top of class.
Built this because he needed it at 16.

**Elliot Fouchy — CPO**
Full-stack. Infra at scale. Makes it run.

---

## Slide 12: The Ask

**€2.5M Seed**
18–24 months runway.

50% — Engineering
30% — Compute
20% — Community

---

## Slide 13: One Sentence

**We’re the Stripe of generative AI.**

Developers build.
Users pay.
We're already inside 1,000+ products.
