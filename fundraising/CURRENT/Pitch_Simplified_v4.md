## Team: Creators who ship

**Thomas Haferlach — CEO**
Amazon AI. Published researcher. Edinburgh AI top of class.
*"As a teenager without a credit card, I hacked my way into apps. I've been building AI-native products ever since—so the next generation of devs don't face those hurdles."*

**Elliot Fouchy — CPO**
Full-stack. Infra at scale.
*"Learning resilience as an engineer on a remote island, I lead ops and ship the infrastructure that keeps Pollinations moving forward."*

## The Moment: Vibe Coding & The New Creator

**Natural language is the new programming.**

- **"Vibe coding"** is Collins Word of the Year 2025 — natural language replaces traditional programming.
- **The Next Billion Users:** A new creator space is emerging—indie devs, hackers, students, and gamers—shipping real products on Discord, Roblox, and GitHub.
- **Technical Moats are gone.** Distribution wins.

Pollinations is the open platform purpose-built for this new mold of **creators**.

## The Friction: Financial Risk vs. User Friction

**Enterprise infra is for startups. Creators are left behind.**

- **The Developer Pain:** Experimentation is expensive. One viral hit can bankrupt an indie builder.
- **The User Pain:** "Subscription Hell." Users won't pay for 10 separate AI subscriptions.

**Creators want to build the fun part. They don't want to build a billing system.**

## Solution: Pollen — The Unified Credit Layer

**One Account. One Balance. Any AI App.**

Our infrastructure is purpose-built for unified authentication, model access, and compute billing as a service.

- **Unified:** One Pollen balance works across every app in the ecosystem.
- **Permissionless:** No API key management, no complex backends.
- **User-Centric:** Users choose which models they pay for inside the experiences they love.

---

## The Mechanics: Build Free. Launch. Get Paid.

The simplest path from experimentation to production.

`Developer gets Pollen → Builds app → App goes live → End users buy Pollen → Revenue flows`

- **Distribution:** Every app shipped is a revenue channel we didn't build.
- **Zero Friction:** No signup required. No backend code.
- **Rev-Share:** Creators earn on every Pollen spent inside their app.

## Traction: Zero Marketing. All Organic.

We are growing because we are the easiest way to build.

| **3M+** | end-users/month (across developer apps) |
| --- | --- |
| **1,000+** | live apps |
| **400+** | new creators joining per day |
| **17K+** | Discord members |
| **3.9K** | GitHub stars |

**The Moat:** A community that compounds. 17K members handle support and ship starter kits. Switching means breaking live products.

---

## The Flywheel: Proof in the Wild

**More apps = more reasons to buy Pollen. More users = more revenue per app.**

- **The Proof:** Our Roblox game has **51M visits** and generates **$12K/month** in user spend.
- **The Scale:** We are bringing this "Roblox for AI" economy to the entire web.
- **The Economics:** Revenue scales with end users, not developer headcount.

## The Landscape: We sell THROUGH creators

|  | HuggingFace | fal.ai | OpenRouter | **Pollinations** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Core role | Model hub | API provider | LLM aggregator | **Distribution layer** |
| Customer | Researchers | Enterprise | Devs-Startups | **Creators** |
| Revenue | Enterprise | Contracts | Usage fees | **End users pay** |

**"Indie platforms don't work."** Neither did Stripe (side projects) or Firebase (hobbyists) until they were inside the products that won. We sit *inside* the winners.
