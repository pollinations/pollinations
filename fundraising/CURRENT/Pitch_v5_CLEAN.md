## POLLINATIONS

The open-source AI platform for creators.
Community-driven. 1,000+ apps live. 3M+ users/month.

## The Problem

**Millions of builders. No infrastructure that fits.**

Every week, a new wave of developers ships AI-powered apps — Discord bots, browser tools, game mods, image generators, creative instruments.

They're not startups. They don't have backend teams.
They build with prompts, ship on GitHub, and find users overnight.

But the moment an app gets traction, they hit a wall:
API keys they can't afford. Billing systems they can't build. Costs they can't predict.

*"What if my app takes off and I can't afford the bill?"*

That fear kills more AI apps than bad code.

And users? They won't pay for 10 separate AI subscriptions. Subscription hell.

## Why Now

**Natural language is the new programming.** "Vibe coding" is Collins Word of the Year 2025.

A new creator space is emerging — indie developers, hackers, students, gamers — shipping real products on Discord, Reddit, and GitHub.

Cloud aggregators focus on startups and enterprise. These **creators** don't fit that mold. Pollinations is the open platform made for them.

## Pollen — One currency for all AI apps

**The simplest compute layer for AI-powered apps.**

- **Zero friction:** No signup, no API keys. One API, all models. It just works.
- **No credit card needed:** Free to start. Pollen credits power everything. 1 Pollen = $1.
- **Users pay, not developers:** End users buy Pollen inside apps. Developers earn a share.

Think of it like electricity. We power the apps. Users pay for the electricity. Creators share the revenue.

Developer builds free → Users buy Pollen inside the app → We take a cut, developer gets the rest.

## Traction

**Zero marketing. All organic.**

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **End-users/month** | 3M+ (across developer apps) |
| **Live apps** | 1,000+ |
| **New devs/day** | 600+ |
| **Discord members** | 17K+ |
| **GitHub stars** | 3.9K |

## Competitors

**We sell THROUGH developers, not TO them.**

|  | HuggingFace | fal.ai | OpenRouter | Pollinations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Core role | Model hub | API provider | LLM aggregator | Distribution layer |
| Customer | Researchers | Enterprise | Devs / Startups | Creators |
| Entry | Use models | Pay-per-use API | API key | No signup needed |
| Revenue | Enterprise | Contracts | Usage fees | End users buy Pollen |

Fal ($4.5B) and OpenRouter ($500M, ~8 people) charge developers.
We let developers build free — then monetize the end users they bring.

## Why We Win

Stripe started with side projects. Firebase started with hobbyists. Both became infrastructure for the products that won.

We're already inside 1,000+ products.

**The moat:** 17K Discord community onboards new devs, handles support, and ships starter kits. Zero support cost at scale. Switching means breaking live products.

---

## Business Model

**Revenue scales with end users, not developer headcount.**

Every app is a storefront we didn't have to build. Developers earn on every Pollen spent — and can cash out to their bank account.

Users buy Pollen once and spend it everywhere. More apps = more reasons to buy. More users = more revenue per app.

**Unit economics:**
- Take rate: 4% of GMV
- Target gross margin: 75%
- CAC: ~$0 (organic / community)

**Proof:** One creator-built gaming app — 51M visits, $12K/month in user spend.

## Aesthetic

Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) gradient background with chunky retro sprites. A cute pixel bee mascot. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley or A Short Hike. Nostalgic but beautiful, emotionally warm, funny wholesome.
