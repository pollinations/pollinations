## 🐝 Team

**Thomas Haferlach (CEO)** — Amazon AI. Published neural networks researcher. Edinburgh AI, top of class. 9 years building creative tech communities in Brazil and Berlin.

> *"I built this because I needed it at 16. No credit card, no access — so the next generation doesn't face those barriers."*

**Elliot Fouchy (CPO)** — Full-stack engineer. Infrastructure at scale. Shipped and runs the entire backend from day one.

## 🌱 The Problem

Every week, a new wave of creators ships AI-powered apps — Discord bots, browser tools, game mods, image generators. They build with prompts, ship on GitHub, find users overnight.

But the moment an app gets traction, they hit a wall: **API keys they can't afford. Billing systems they can't build. Costs they can't predict.**

The ecosystem is fragmented. Enterprise AI requires complex backends and billing. Consumer tools are walled gardens — no way to build on top of them.

**For creators: infrastructure they can't afford.**
**For users: subscription hell.**

## 🍯 Pollen — One Currency for All AI Apps

**1 Pollen = $1.** Think of it like electricity. We power the apps. Users pay for the electricity. Creators share the revenue.

> **Creator builds free → App goes live → Users buy Pollen → We take a cut, creator gets the rest**

Creators are our distribution. Every app is a storefront we didn't have to build. Creators earn on every Pollen spent — and can cash out to their bank.

---

## ⚡ Why Now

Natural language is the new programming. "Vibe coding" is Collins Word of the Year 2025. Models are commoditizing — value is shifting to distribution. The winners will be platforms that turn creators into distribution channels.

---

## 💰 Business Model

Users buy Pollen once and spend it everywhere. More apps = more reasons to buy. More users = more revenue per app.

**Proof:** *One creator-built game — 51M visits, $12K/month in user spend. We earn on every transaction. No outbound sales.*

---

## 🏆 Why We Win

**We sell through creators, not to them.** Fal, OpenRouter, and others charge developers. We let creators build free, then monetize the end users they bring.

**Self-scaling distribution.** Every app is an acquisition channel we didn't pay for.

**Community that compounds.** 17K Discord members shipping starter kits, onboarding new creators. Zero support cost at scale.

**Defensibility.** 1,000+ apps in production — switching means breaking live products. Network effects: more apps → more users → more revenue → repeat.
