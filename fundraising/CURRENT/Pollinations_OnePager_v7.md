# Pollinations — The Creator Economy for AI Micro-Apps

**Creators build— a calorie tracker that reads food photos, bedtime stories for kids, a Roblox game with 51M visits. When users love them, they pay with Pollen. 1,000+ apps live today.**

| 3M+ end-users/mo | 1,000+ live apps | 600+ new devs/day | 17K+ Discord | 4K GitHub stars |

### For Creators
- One API that scales, all models, zero backend code
- Earn revenue on every user transaction
- Community of 17K builders and millions of users

### For Users
- No subscription hell — one balance, every app
- Full control over what you spend and where
- Discover new apps built by the community

## The Problem

**For creators:** Success punishes you. Your app goes viral and suddenly you owe thousands in compute bills. Every other platform charges the developer — so the more users you get, the more you pay.

**For users:** Every micro-app wants its own subscription. No one pays $10/month for a calorie tracker.

## Pollen — One Currency for All AI Apps

**1 Pollen = $1.** Think of it like electricity — we power the apps, users pay for the electricity, creators share the revenue.

**Creator builds free → App goes live → Users buy Pollen → Creator earns, we take a cut**

## Business Model

Users buy Pollen once and spend it everywhere. More apps = more reasons to buy. More users = more revenue per app.

*Proof: One creator-built Roblox game — 51M visits, $12K/month in user spend. We earn on every transaction. No outbound sales.*

## Why We Win

**We sell through creators, not to them.** Fal, Replicate, OpenRouter charge developers. We let creators build free, then monetize the end users they bring.

**Apps are storefronts and templates.** Each app brings its own users — and because most are open source, every app is also a template others fork and adapt. One app becomes ten.

**Community runs itself.** Discord members onboard new creators, share starter kits, answer questions. No support team needed.

## Team

**Thomas Haferlach (CEO)** — Amazon AI · Published neural networks researcher · Edinburgh AI, top of class · 9 years building creative tech communities.

**Elliot Fouchy (CPO)** — Full-stack engineer · Infrastructure at scale · Runs the entire backend from day one.

Second-time founders. Worked together leading technical teams. Backed by Antler Berlin.

## The Ask

**€2.5M Seed**

50% Compute & Infrastructure · 30% Engineering · 20% Community

**Milestones:** Q1 in-app Pollen payments · Q2 creator rev-share · Q3 app discovery

## Why Now

Teenagers are skipping school to vibe code. Anyone can build an AI app in an afternoon.

Models are commoditizing — value is shifting to distribution. The winners will be platforms that turn millions of new creators into distribution channels.

## Defensibility

Hundreds of apps in production — switching means breaking real products.

Network effects — more apps → more users → more creators → repeat.

## Market Position
