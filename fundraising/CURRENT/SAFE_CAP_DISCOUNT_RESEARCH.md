## 2025 Market Benchmarks

### Valuation Caps by Round Size (Carta Q3 2025)

| Round Size | Median Val Cap (Post-Money SAFE) |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| <$500K | $5-7M |
| $500K-$1M | $8-12M |
| $1M-$2.5M | $12-18M |
| >$2.5M | $20M+ (trending up) |

**Key Finding**: Val caps for post-money SAFEs have stayed flat or risen in 2025, especially for larger rounds (>$2.5M).

### Regional Differences (2025 Data)

| Region | Avg Pre-Seed Valuation | Typical Dilution |
|--------|------------------------|------------------|
| **United States** | $5.27M | 19.69% |
| **Middle East** | $3.70M | 24.80% |
| **Europe** | $3.24M | 21.00% |
| **Oceania** | $3.32M | 11.67% |

**For Pollinations (Estonia/Europe)**: European valuations are lower than US, but AI companies command a **1.3x premium** over general market.

### AI Sector Premium

| Sector | Median Seed Deal Size |
|--------|----------------------|
| **AI/ML Infrastructure** | $4.6M (1.3x market premium) |
| Healthcare/Biotech | $4.6M |
| Fintech | $3.2M |
| SaaS (General) | $2.8M |
| Consumer | $2.1M |

## Cap vs. Discount: When to Use Which

### Use a Cap When:
- Risk is mostly market/performance related
- No existential assumptions (regulatory, clinical trials, etc.)
- You want clear ownership expectations upfront
- **Pollinations fits this category** ✅

### Use a Discount When:
- High uncertainty about future valuation
- Want to defer pricing entirely
- Willing to accept unclear dilution

### Current Market Trend
- **Caps are the default** for most seed rounds
- Discounts have fallen out of favor (median now just 20%)
- Most SAFEs use cap only, or cap + discount as sweetener

## Recommended Terms for Pollinations

### Option A: Cap Only (Recommended)
| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Valuation Cap** | €10M-€12M post-money | Antler invested at €5.07M post-money; 2x reflects growth |
| **Discount** | None | Cleaner, simpler |
| **Dilution** | 17-22% | Standard for €1.5M-€2.5M raise |

### Option B: Cap + Discount (If Needed for Negotiation)
| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Valuation Cap** | €12M post-money | Higher cap |
| **Discount** | 15-20% | Sweetener if cap is high |
| **Dilution** | 15-20% | Slightly lower |

## Antler SAFE Context

> ⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED**: Verify exact terms from legal documents

**Existing Antler Investment** *(NEEDS VERIFICATION)*:
- Amount: €300K *(VERIFY)*
- Post-money cap: €5.07M *(VERIFY)*
- Pre-money: ~€4.7M *(CALCULATED)*
- Implied ownership: ~5.9% *(CALCULATED)*

**⚠️ Thomas**: Please confirm these figures from the actual SAFE agreement before using in investor materials.

**Implications for New Round**:
- New cap should be higher than Antler's cap (reflects growth)
- 2x-2.5x increase is reasonable given traction
- Antler's SAFE will convert at their cap, not the new higher cap

---

## MFN (Most Favored Nation) Clause

### What It Does
MFN ensures early investors get the benefit of any better terms offered to later investors in the same round.

### Best Practices
1. **Include MFN for early investors** - protects them if you offer better terms later
2. **Re-price existing SAFEs if you raise at lower cap** - even without MFN, it's best practice
3. **MFN does NOT compound over time** - this is a known flaw
4. **MFN typically applies to same round only** - not future priced rounds

### Recommendation for Pollinations
- ✅ Include MFN clause for all SAFEs in this round
- ✅ Keep terms consistent across all investors
- ✅ If raising in tranches, increment cap slightly for later tranches

## Dilution Modeling

### Scenario: €2.5M Raise at €12M Post-Money Cap

| Investor | Investment | Ownership Post-Conversion |
|----------|------------|---------------------------|
| **Antler (existing)** | €300K at €5.07M cap | ~5.9% |
| **New Investors** | €2.5M at €12M cap | ~20.8% |
| **Founders** | — | ~73.3% |

### Scenario: €1.5M Raise at €10M Post-Money Cap

| Investor | Investment | Ownership Post-Conversion |
|----------|------------|---------------------------|
| **Antler (existing)** | €300K at €5.07M cap | ~5.9% |
| **New Investors** | €1.5M at €10M cap | ~15% |
| **Founders** | — | ~79.1% |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **€10M-€12M cap is defensible** given AI premium and traction
2. **Cap-only SAFE is cleaner** than cap + discount
3. **20% discount is market standard** if you need one
4. **Include MFN clause** to protect early investors
5. **European valuations are lower** but AI premium applies
6. **Antler's €5.07M cap sets a floor** - new cap should be higher
