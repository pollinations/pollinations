## Core Narrative Thread

### The Young Developer's Dream
What 18-year-old me wanted:
- Free access to powerful AI tools
- Learn by doing, not gatekept
- See how things actually work (open source)
- Recognition for contributions
- Path from playing to building real products

This became our design principle.

### The Insight
- **AI makes cloning easy** → technical advantage lasts months
- **But:** Communities create exponential value
- **We chose openness** → Got contributors, not copycats

---

## Our Open Source Everything

**What we opened:**
- Backend code
- Billing code
- Pricing
- Development discussions on Discord

**Cognitive benefit:** Zero overhead deciding what to hide

**What we got back:**
- 5K developers building WITH us
- 1K apps published
- Community examples:
  - 7 Roblox games (one hit 51M visits, $12K earned)
  - Minecraft integrations
  - Discord bots
  - YouTube tutorials
  - New AI models deployed before we knew
- Indian students coding through holidays, refusing payment

## The Economics Revolution

### Problem
- Free tiers hit walls (40 msgs/day, strict limits)
- Developers build → go viral → costs explode
- Example: Some apps jump from $2→$20/day overnight

### Solution: User-Pays Model
- Inspired by Puter.js approach
- Developers build → users pay their own usage → innovation scales
- No surprise bills for developers
- Result: $820 weekly revenue → 229% WoW growth

### Mini VC for Young Developers
- Gamified proof-of-work: GitHub activity = Pollen credits
- Supporting next generation of builders
- 600+ new developers joining daily
