## 1. The Hook (30s)

"I started coding when I was 13. I had ideas, but no credit card. It took me years to build anything real because the tools were locked away.

Today, there are millions of teenagers just like that. They’re 'vibe coding' with ChatGPT, generating apps in seconds. But the moment they try to deploy, they hit a wall.
OpenAI requires an API key. AWS requires a credit card. Enterprise platforms require a sales call.

The next Zuckerberg is probably a 16-year-old in Brazil or Indonesia, and right now, they are locked out of the AI revolution."

## 2. The Solution (45s)

"That’s why we built **Pollinations**.
We are the simplest compute layer for the AI generation.

Think of us as the 'Roblox for AI'.
We provide one unified API for all major models—OpenAI, Llama, Flux, you name it.
But here’s the difference:
1.  **Zero Friction**: You don't need a signup. You don't need an API key. You write one line of code, and it works.
2.  **No Credit Card**: It’s free to start.
3.  **Community-Powered**: We have a gamified economy. If you contribute code to our open-source repo, you earn 'Pollen' credits to run your apps.

We turned compute into a currency that anyone can earn, regardless of where they live or what bank they use."

## 3. The Traction (45s)

"And this is resonating wildly. We spend **zero dollars** on marketing.
Yet, our organic growth is exponential:
*   We have **600+ new developers** joining *every single day*.
*   We have **3 million** monthly active users across the ecosystem.
*   There are over **1,000 live apps** built on Pollinations—from discord bots to creative tools to games.
*   Our Discord has **17,000 members** helping each other build.

We’ve built a flywheel where developers come for the free tier, stay for the community, and help us build the platform itself."

## 4. The Business Model (45s)

"Now, how do we make money?
We’re flipping the infrastructure model.
Instead of charging the developer (who has no money), we enable **End-User Payments**.

We’re piloting this now with apps like *Pictify*:
The developer builds for free. The end-user pays micropayments for premium generations. We take a cut, the developer takes a cut, and we pay the model provider.

It’s exactly how Roblox works. They paid out over **$1 billion** to creators last year. We are bringing that same model to AI apps."

## 5. The Ask & Vision (30s)

"We are raising a **€1.5M - €2.5M Seed Round** to scale this economy.
We have the technology. We have the community. We have the traction.
Now we need the fuel to become the default infrastructure for the next generation of creators.

My name is Thomas. I’m an AI researcher ex-Amazon, and I built Pollinations because it’s what I wished I had when I was 16.
Join us."
