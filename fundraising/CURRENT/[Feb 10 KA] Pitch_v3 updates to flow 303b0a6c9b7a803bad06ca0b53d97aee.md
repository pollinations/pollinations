# [Feb 10 KA] Pitch_v3 updates to flow

# POLLINATIONS PITCH DECK v3→v4 in progress — DRAFT OUTLINE

*Revised flow. Problem and user land in the first 2 minutes. Team moved after “Why Now.” Roblox used as economic analogy, not lead example.*

---

## SLIDE 1 — TITLE

**POLLINATIONS**

Developers build free. Users pay.

The payment and compute layer for the next generation of AI apps.

1,000+ apps. 3M+ users. €2.5M Seed.

---

## SLIDE 2 — THE PROBLEM

**Millions of builders. No infrastructure that fits.**

Every week, a new wave of developers ships AI-powered apps — Discord bots, browser tools, game mods, image generators, creative instruments.

They’re not startups. They don’t have backend teams.
They build with prompts, ship on GitHub, and find users overnight.

But the moment an app gets traction, they hit a wall:
API keys they can’t afford. Billing systems they can’t build. Costs they can’t predict.

***“What if my app takes off and I can’t afford the bill?”***

That fear kills more AI apps than bad code.

---

## SLIDE 3 — WHY NOW

**Natural language is the new programming.**

“Vibe coding” — Collins Dictionary Word of the Year 2025.
Anyone with a prompt can build an app.

Teenagers are shipping production software on Discord and GitHub.
Indie devs are building real businesses without engineering teams.

AI models are becoming commodities.
The value is shifting from who builds the model to who distributes it.

**Technical moats are gone. Distribution wins.**

---

## SLIDE 4 — TEAM

**Creators. Technical Founders. Who Ship.**

**Thomas Haferlach — CEO**
Amazon AI · Published neural networks researcher · Edinburgh AI, top of class
9 years building creative tech communities in Brazil and Berlin

*“I built this because I needed it at 16. No credit card, no access. I’ve been building AI-native products ever since — so the next generation doesn’t face those barriers.”*

**Elliot Fouchy — CPO**
Full-stack engineer · Infrastructure at scale
Shipped and runs Pollinations’ entire backend from day one

*“I keep it running so builders can keep building.”*

---

## SLIDE 5 — POLLEN: THE PRODUCT

**One currency for all AI apps.**

Every AI app today has its own login, its own payment, its own billing.
For builders, that’s infrastructure they can’t afford.
For users, that’s friction they won’t tolerate.

Pollen replaces all of it with one system.

**1 Pollen = $1**

Developers add Pollen to their app with one API call.
Users buy Pollen once — and spend it across 1,000+ apps.

No API keys. No backend. No billing code. Just build.

---

## SLIDE 6 — HOW IT WORKS

**Developer gets Pollen → Builds app → App goes live → End users buy Pollen → Revenue flows**

**For developers:** One API call. Any model. Zero setup.
**For users:** One wallet. 1,000+ apps. Buy once, use everywhere.

Every app a developer ships becomes a revenue channel we didn’t build.

**Developers are our distribution.**

---

## SLIDE 7 — THE NETWORK EFFECT

**More apps. More users. More revenue. Repeat.**

A user might use 10 AI apps and never visit pollinations.ai.
But every app shares one Pollen balance.

More apps → more reasons to buy Pollen.
More users → more revenue per app.
More revenue → more developers building.

**The economic model:**
Think Robux — but for AI. Roblox didn’t just sell games. They created an economy where players earn, spend, and trade credits across millions of experiences.

Pollen follows the same path: starts as compute credits, becomes an ecosystem currency.

**Familiar patterns:**
Stripe for payments → Pollen for AI credits
Auth0 for identity → Pollen with built-in AI consent
OpenRouter for routing → Pollen, but user-centric

---

## SLIDE 8 — TRACTION

**Zero marketing. All organic.**

3M+ end-users/month across developer apps
1,000+ live apps shipping real products
400+ new developers joining daily — $0 spent on acquisition
17K+ Discord community members
3.9K GitHub stars

We’re growing because we’re the easiest way to build.

---

## SLIDE 9 — WHY WE WIN

**We sell THROUGH developers, not TO them.**

Fal ($4.5B valuation) and OpenRouter ($500M valuation, ~8 people) proved unified AI APIs are a venture-scale category.

They charge developers.
We let developers build free — then monetize the end users they bring.

1,000+ apps = 1,000+ acquisition channels we didn’t pay for.

**Two sides, one economy.**
For developers: free infrastructure, zero setup.
For end users: one account, 1,000+ AI apps, one balance.

---

## SLIDE 10 — BUSINESS MODEL

**Revenue scales with end users, not developer headcount.**

Dev builds free → App launches → Users buy Pollen → We collect revenue.

Users don’t buy per app. They buy Pollen once and spend it everywhere.
More apps = more reasons to buy. More users = more revenue per app.

**Proof: one developer, one game.**
A single Roblox game — 51M visits, $12K/month in developer revenue.
We earn from every Pollen used. No outbound sales. No account management.

Now multiply that across 1,000 apps. Then 10,000.

## SLIDE 11 — COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

**They charge developers. We charge their users.**

|  | HuggingFace | fal.ai | OpenRouter | Pollinations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Role | Model hub | API provider | LLM aggregator | Distribution layer |
| Customer | Researchers | Enterprise | Devs/Startups | Creators |
| Entry barrier | Use models | Pay-per-use | API key | No signup needed |
| Revenue from | Enterprise | Contracts | Dev usage fees | End users buy Pollen |

OpenRouter raised $40M (a16z + Sequoia) at $500M — proving unified AI APIs are a category.
They charge developers 5% on inference. We let developers build free and monetize end users.

---

## SLIDE 12 — THE MOAT

**Community that compounds.**

17K Discord members + bots — answering questions, shipping starter kits, onboarding new devs.

Zero support cost at scale. Community handles what would cost a full team.

Switching means breaking live products. 1,000+ apps with deep integration = massive lock-in.

---

## SLIDE 13 — PRECEDENT

**“Indie platforms don’t scale.”**

Stripe started with side projects. Now worth $70B+.
Firebase started with hobbyists. Acquired by Google.

They won because they were inside the products that won.

A thousand seeds. We only need a few to bloom.

---

## SLIDE 14 — MARKET SIZE

**The long tail of AI products.**

50M+ indie builders globally, shipping apps, games, bots, and tools.
Each product brings users. Users bring spend.

Consumer AI spend is shifting from single destination apps to embedded experiences inside thousands of products.

We sit inside those products. We grow as they grow.

Our market scales with the number of AI apps that exist — and that number is exploding.

---

## SLIDE 15 — THE ASK

**€2.5M Seed**

50% — Compute & Infrastructure
30% — Engineering
20% — Community & Growth

**Goal:** Become the default infrastructure for AI-native developers.
Power the long tail of AI apps.

---

## SLIDE 16 — CLOSING

**We’re the Stripe of generative AI.**

Developers build.
Users pay.
We’re already inside 1,000+ products.

## Summary of Changes from v3

| Change | Why |
| --- | --- |
| **Slide order:** Title → Problem → Why Now → Team → Pollen → … | Problem lands before team. Investor feels tension before meeting the solvers. |
| **Problem slide rewritten from scratch** | No more “Enterprise vs Consumer” framing. Starts with the builder’s experience. Fear quote is the punchline. |
| **Team moved to slide 4** | Credentials land harder after investor understands the opportunity |
| **Thomas gets community-building credential** | 9 years of creative tech communities is a key signal for a community-driven business |
| **Roblox moved to Business Model (slide 10)** | Used as proof the model works, not as user definition. Avoids “Roblox AI tool” perception. |
| **Robux analogy in Network Effect (slide 7)** | Explains the economic model, not the user. “Think Robux, but for AI” is an economy comparison. |
| **Moat and Precedent split into two slides** | Each idea gets room to breathe. Precedent is its own narrative beat. |
| **Removed $50-100B TAM** | Narrative framing is safer at seed. “Our market scales with AI apps” is stronger. |
| **Removed Flora reference** | No investor knows what this is |
| **Removed Alexandr Wang attribution** | Could be challenged. The point stands without a name attached. |
| **Pollen subtitle changed** | “One currency for all AI apps” > “Compute for the next billion consumers of AI apps” |
| **“Distribution Layer” subtitle removed** | Sounds like B2B positioning. The story speaks for itself. |

## Roblox Usage Guide (for the live pitch)

Where Roblox appears and why:

1. **Slide 7 (Network Effect):** “Think Robux — but for AI.” This is an *economic model* comparison. You’re explaining how Pollen works as a cross-app currency, like Robux works across Roblox experiences. This is about the system design, not the customer.
2. **Slide 10 (Business Model):** “One developer, one game — 51M visits, $12K/month.” This is *proof the flywheel works*. One specific case study showing the economics in action. Framed as “one developer” not “a Roblox game.”
3. **Nowhere else.** The word “Roblox” should not appear in the title slide, problem slide, user definition, or competitive landscape. The platform examples in the Problem slide are “Discord bots, browser tools, game mods, image generators, creative instruments” — diverse, not Roblox-specific.

If an investor asks “so this is for Roblox?”, the answer is: “Roblox is one platform where our developers ship. We also have developers on Discord, GitHub, web apps, mobile — 1,000+ apps across the full spectrum. The Roblox game is just our biggest single success story.”
