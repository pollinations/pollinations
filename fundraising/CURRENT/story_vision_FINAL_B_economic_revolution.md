**Focus: Solving economics to unlock global creativity**

## Story (~60 sec)

### Opening Hook
- "Three 18-year-olds are building a professional voice clone for an artist. They found us on Discord. They're not unique - we have thousands like them."

### The Economics Problem
- Amazon AI engineer → saw the same pattern everywhere
- Developers build amazing things → go viral → costs explode
- Real example: AI Project GPT went from $2 to $20/day overnight
- Free tiers aren't enough: rate limits kill production apps
- The economics were broken for creators

### The Personal Mission
- Started coding at 13 - remember the hunger to build
- Built creative community for 9 years - understood value creation
- Combined both insights: What if users paid for their own AI usage?
- Like how free-to-play revolutionized gaming economics

### The Open Source Surprise
- Decided to open source everything: backend, billing, pricing
- Mental model: Zero overhead deciding what to hide
- 5K developers now building WITH us
- 1K apps already published on our platform
- Community examples:
  - 7 Roblox games using our tech
  - Minecraft integrations overnight
  - Portrait XO voice clone project
  - Indian students refusing payment, just want to build
