**Pollinations Strategy & Fundraising Meeting \- Jan 7, 2026**  
**🎯 Core Value Proposition**  
**The Problem**

* **Technical complexity**: Building AI apps requires navigating fragmented APIs, multiple providers, different pricing models, subscriptions  
* **High barrier to entry**: Most AI APIs require credit cards, signups, and complicated onboarding  
* **Growing demand**: As "boats disappear" (coding barriers vanish), everyone will build apps requiring AI features

**The Solution**  
**One simple API** → access to all popular AI models

* **No friction start**: One line of code \= generated image (no signup required)  
* **Usage-based pricing**: Pay only for what you use ($1 \= 5000 images)  
* **Unified access**: Text, image, speech, video models through single endpoint

**📊 Growth & Traction**  
**Current Metrics**

* **\~600 users/day** signing up  
* **Weekly revenue growing** (started from zero with new payment system)  
* **Token usage trending exponentially** (last 4 weeks)  
* **Conversion challenge**: High drop-off at checkout (payment method limitations)

**User Journey**

1. **Discovery** → Free tier, no signup, instant results  
2. **Experimentation** → Limited free usage sufficient for prototyping  
3. **Conversion** → Sign up when they need consistent compute/premium models  
4. **Retention** → Community support \+ low switching cost makes staying easier than leaving

**Why Users Stay**

| Factor | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Psychological** | Easy to use, familiar, low cognitive load |
| **Commercial** | Low-cost, competitive pricing, flexible payment |
| **Social** | Active community, Discord support, shared knowledge |

————————  
**👥 Community as Moat**  
**Three Pillars**

1. **Human Support**: Questions answered by community members, not just docs  
2. **Technical Contributions**: Community updates code, recommends models, implements features  
3. **Quality Automation**: AI agents \+ test harnesses maintain repo quality from community PRs

**Community Dynamics**

* **Hobbyist energy**: Like birdhouse builders nerding out together  
* **Emotional reward**: Being part of something, supporting growth  
* **App ecosystem**: 100s of apps built, open-source examples to clone/remix  
* **User → Customer flywheel**: App users become Pollinations users (Roblox model)

**💰 Fundraising Plan**  
**Timeline**

| Week | Milestone |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Now \- 2 weeks** | Finalize pitch deck, nail the "excitement" narrative |
| **Week 2-3** | Test pitch with "tier 2/3" investors (closer contacts) |
| **Week 3-4** | Incorporate feedback, refine |
| **Feb onwards** | Approach tier 1 investors |

**Target Raise**

* **Amount**: $1.5M \- $2.5M (stretch: $3M)  
* **Dilution**: 17-22% typical at seed  
* **Valuation**: Function of amount raised  
* **Key metric needed**: Show path to Series A indicators (20K MRR, 30% MoM growth)

**Pitch Structure**

1. **Who you are** \- Background, why you're the one to build this  
2. **Problem** \- Fragmented AI APIs, complexity, barriers  
3. **Solution** \- One API, all models, no friction  
4. **Traction** \- Growth charts, user numbers, revenue start  
5. **Vision** \- Where this is going (customization, fine-tuning, etc.)

————————  
**🚀 Artifact Accelerator Application**  
**Details**

* **Program**: Founders Inc. Artifact  
* **Offer**: $250K \+ $500K in credits (Replicate, etc.)  
* **Status**: Still accepting late applications  
* **Deadline**: ASAP (looking for 5 more teams)

**Application Components**  
	☐	Online form (straightforward)  
	☐	60-second video pitch  
	☐	Team info (can add Elliot later)  
	☐	Metrics screenshot (show growth trajectory)  
**Video Structure (60 sec)**

1. **Problem** (10s): Making it easy for anyone to build AI apps  
2. **Solution** (15s): What Pollinations does  
3. **Your story** (20s): Background, why you  
4. **Traction** (15s): "Last week we launched payments, already seeing X growth"

————————  
**🔮 Future Vision**  
**Near-term**

* **User-as-customer conversion**: App users pay with Pollen credits  
* **Roblox integration**: Kids buying Pollen with Robux

**Long-term Positioning**

* **Custom model fine-tuning**: Upload voice samples → get personalized TTS model  
* **Not competing with Hugging Face** (model hosting)  
* **Not competing with Lovable/Replit** (app building)  
* **Unique position**: The compute layer for AI-native apps  
* **As barriers disappear**: More builders → more AI features needed → more compute
