Let’s go over venture basics for growth investment and ballpark team costs, and what vcs are looking for 

## **A Work Backwards!  What are investors seeking?**

**How investment works** 
*ballpark estimates below, used for illustration only* 

Investors will want a decent stake and manage future dilution. Based on pollinations profile:

Scenario 1 valn is high for investors doing 1-3m seed 
Scenario 2 valn and size is typical for 1-3m seed

**Scenario 1 Tech Team Size, 2-3yrs funding**

***investor high conviction** in team, opportunity and growth*

10 Team x 3 Years

- Team: 2.5m/yr x 3 years = 7.5m
- Office: 0.5m/yr x 3 years = 1.5m
- Buffer/growth: 1m/yr x 3years = 3m

**Total = 12m raise** 

**Seed and/or A Fundraise  - VC takes upto 20%**

- **seed + A rounds : 4m (1year) + 8m.**  
Valn. Year 1: 20m , Year 2: 50m
- **seed: 12m**
Valn: 50m

*The bet
loves team, expects strong growth, revenues 
follow on rounds in 12-18mths (not 3 yrs) to accelerate (or gets acquired, or dies)*

In both scenarios investors require: **Growth**

**Scenario 2 Small Team, 1-2 years funding**

***investor excited about opportunity**. conviction in team, growth*

Small Team, upto 1-2 years 

- Team: 1.5m
- Office: 0.5m
- Buffer/growth: 1m

**Total = 3m raise**

**Seed Fundraise   - VC takes upto 20%**

- **seed: 3m**
Valn: 12m

*The bet
likes team, expects to iterate to find revenues from product/user fit and grow
follow on round from new VCs in 12-18mths ( is sustainable, or dies)*

## B What are they investing in

Currently, pollinations community is creating: 

- Assets (media: visual, audio, 3D)
- Experiences (apps, game, meme)

## C Where is the excitement

**Growth**

- community growth: “16k →” “Github stars” …
    - growth managed by AI agents
    - app users (multipliers)
- dev kits (multipliers)
    - games, ….
- *revenue*
    - *pollen sold (indicator of demand, stickiness) - novel business model*

## D Why invest

**Team**

- is this the right team to grow this

**Timing (Acquire vs Growth)**

- who would acquire this
    - potential high **conversion funnel** for ai native audience to users
    - others
- how big can it grow
    - **ai native customers** with growing revenue →

**Who has invested already**
