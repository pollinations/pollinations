> Thomas
> 
> Obsessed with AI as a teenager
> 
- Specialised in AI at University, Graduated top of class
- Worked at large tech cos and gen ai cos - appreciated dev community feel
- Noticed challenges for devs
    - Access to tools, needing a credit card
    - No community
- Solving this at pollinations by providing simple to access compute for app devs building ai features
- Vision - the simplest compute layer for ai powered apps

*This is a **strong spine already** 👍
What it needs now is **emotional causality + inevitability** — so it feels less like a CV and more like a founder myth that could only lead to Pollinations.*

*Below is a **tightened story arc**, followed by **two pitch-ready versions** you can directly drop into **Pollinations / Myceli decks** (short + long).*

## **1. Refined Story Arc (Narrative Logic)**

**Core transformation:** *From obsessed builder → insider → disillusioned witness → system designer*

### **Act I — Obsession**

- Thomas grew up obsessed with AI **before it was cool**
- Tinkered with models, systems, and automation as a teenager
- Not chasing hype — chasing *understanding*

> “AI wasn’t a product to him. It was a tool to extend human creativity.”
> 

### **Act II — Mastery**

- Specialized in AI at university
- Graduated top of his class
- Entered the most advanced AI and big-tech environments

> He was inside the machine, not watching from the outside.
> 

### **Act III — Friction**

- Loved the **developer culture** inside great tech companies
- But saw the same pattern everywhere:
    - Access gated by **credit cards**
    - Fragmented APIs
    - No shared community layer
    - Builders wasting time on infra instead of ideas

> “The hardest part of building with AI wasn’t intelligence — it was access.”
> 

### **Act IV — Insight**

- AI was becoming *foundational infrastructure*
- Yet the **on-ramp was broken**
- The people most capable of building the future were locked out by:
    - Cost
    - Complexity
    - Corporate silos

This wasn’t a tooling problem.

It was a **compute distribution problem**.

### **Act V — Inevitability**

- Pollinations wasn’t started as a company
- It started as a **fix**
- A way to make AI feel:
    - Instant
    - Shareable
    - Community-driven
    - As easy as calling a function
