**Pollinations Strategy & Fundraising Meeting - Jan 7, 2026**

Figma Notes from Meeting - (raw, unedited)

[Pollen.pdf](Jan%207,%202026%20Pollinations%20Strategy%20&%20Fundraising%20Me/Pollen.pdf)

**🎯 Core Value Proposition**

**The Problem**

- **Technical complexity**: Building AI apps requires navigating fragmented APIs, multiple providers, different pricing models, subscriptions
- **High barrier to entry**: Most AI APIs require credit cards, signups, and complicated onboarding
- **Growing demand**: As "moats disappear" (coding barriers vanish), everyone will build apps requiring AI features

**The Solution**

**One simple API** → access to all popular AI models

- **No friction start**: One line of code = generated image (no signup required)
- **Usage-based pricing**: Pay only for what you use ($1 = 5000 images)
- **Unified access**: Text, image, speech, video models through single endpoint

————————

**📊 Growth & Traction**

**Current Metrics**

- **~600 users/day** signing up
- **Weekly revenue growing** (started from zero with new payment system)
- **Token usage trending exponentially** (last 4 weeks)
- **Conversion challenge**: High drop-off at checkout (payment method limitations)

**User Journey**

1. **Discovery** → Free tier, no signup, instant results
2. **Experimentation** → Limited free usage sufficient for prototyping
3. **Conversion** → Sign up when they need consistent compute/premium models
4. **Retention** → Community support + low switching cost makes staying easier than leaving

**Why Users Stay**

| **Factor** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Psychological** | Easy to use, familiar, low cognitive load |
| **Commercial** | Low-cost, competitive pricing, flexible payment |
| **Social** | Active community, Discord support, shared knowledge |

————————

**👥 Community as Moat**

**Three Pillars**

1. **Human Support**: Questions answered by community members, not just docs
2. **Technical Contributions**: Community updates code, recommends models, implements features
3. **Quality Automation**: AI agents + test harnesses maintain repo quality from community PRs

**Community Dynamics**

- **Hobbyist energy**: Like birdhouse builders nerding out together
- **Emotional reward**: Being part of something, supporting growth
- **App ecosystem**: 100s of apps built, open-source examples to clone/remix
- **User → Customer flywheel**: App users become Pollinations users (Roblox model)

————————

**💰 Fundraising Plan**

**Timeline**

| **Week** | **Milestone** |
| --- | --- |

| **Week 2-3** | Test pitch with "tier 2/3" investors (closer contacts) |
| **Week 3-4** | Incorporate feedback, refine |
| **Feb onwards** | Approach tier 1 investors |

**Target Raise**

- **Amount**: $1.5M - $2.5M (stretch: $3M)
- **Dilution**: 17-22% typical at seed
- **Valuation**: Function of amount raised
- **Key metric needed**: Show path to Series A indicators (20K MRR, 30% MoM growth)

**Pitch Structure**

1. **Who you are** - Background, why you're the one to build this
2. **Problem** - Fragmented AI APIs, complexity, barriers
3. **Solution** - One API, all models, no friction

**Transcript**

I think you can go on the page and you can use it to bits and then you can sign up and then you have a little bit of kind of free. Free free, you know, got sick because you could start jumping into using the API without having to sign up at or, you know, this is not a sales funnel.

You noticed, how we how we captured to use it. And that one thing with apis, which I think it's important to say, which is like when your user data, I'm using like a istudio from Google. You know why I'm using replicate? I'm using one of the Thousand side where I can get different kinds of of of of Then I have a lot of choice, do you know?

I can make ten Google accounts and and and used as much as I as I want is for long time. The only way you can just kind of like the dogs vitamins if you know, just with one line you have a generated image on your homepage even without that and the reason it's so easy.

It's because once you once you add, you know, if indication is like checking making sure that the user account because you as soon as you cannot do this, we did just think the laptop. You need it back. When you need to track your users, you need to make sure they login, you know, this complication is needed for any of the other.

I could none of them like offer this. I like free easy-to-use at it and then what happens is that it's quite limited this reaction. So then we end up kind of pushing users to use an API key, will try to make it as easy as possible for them. So they don't have to do all this back and working the pain of switching to another day.

If you had much higher than like an end-user, who decides I'm going to use another app, you know, to make my images, you know, once you've integrated it in your abscess, I think it's a combination of making it very easy to start. And then like, kind of locking people in by a kind of getting into upgrade to a regular accounts, you know, two steps.

One of this is what fraction to a starting. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that works for a lot of people trying things out. And whether they are proficient coders, or are people using 52 and fuels our combination with this is the compute. This is no friction way of getting that.

Yeah, it's about the providers. So is the fastest way to 2 to begin apps are built on the applications are developed using CPI to the next step is to the next step to to have consistent compute. Exactly like a free API on the office of a small subset of the cheaper so you can make for your friend. Do you know with the with the free one bit?

As soon as you want in a kind of you, you start getting some users and you will not offer some like kind of features an extra features. You, you have to kind of sign up for eventually. Pain, right? That they Steve. Because they hit their familiar with it. And also, they said that the strong support of Community Action loberia, starting point, the journey eventually takes to fix a user's guide to growing up into the direction of being becoming a paid user again, they stayed because it's the easiest way for them to, to start and easy as they have a community in there, that its support of the Poland.

All that is movies. A business model is very simple for them. It's adaptable to to everyone's needs and they don't get a sense of being tied to you, but the convenience and staying with you makeup,

Easy to just kind of change provider and so on the phone with my uncle, I can be ready for that. But I mean, we can also kind of look it up. How many are sticking with it? Seems like we could quite quite quite as good, a good way of describing.

What the, what it is, what it is, you offer and why this apps exist in combination with that list of apps. So I think that's good. That's a good one. You have, you've already have trucks to do people using it. Why are they using it? Is the is the question, and the answer is no, friction starts.

And once you're in this Community the support is typically. Once once people are are in and paying they they don't want to swap but change their back in architecture for new provider. Another point and I have never been a hundred percent sure how much we should like it. Kind of bring food when we look at that pricing table and I check out a provider and and and I'm kind of surprised, I'm still surprised because I would have imagined to competition between providers would bring everyone to to really really surprised with one parent with you.

Make like 5,000 m with any of the API they usually has a magnitude higher.

Yeah, and it makes sense like, in the fact is now we shouldn't like maybe a administrator of apis of others. But actually, we realize that we're not renting, the we're not having the Jeep used in a in-house, another level, right? Where you rent a cheap used and then you deploy the model on the road.

Gpus know that two options you which like with a W asked if you're reading this on our machine is running on their machines and we can rent cheap cheap used to provide and that's how I feel like we can compete quite well on price at least it seems like that at the moment. Issues right now, you don't take much out of that $1 yet, so that's why it is high.

The question is, how do you maintain that way forward? Then that's good. Have you model that out? Because we would have a bunch of teens, you know, the Indians Alex Felice. Actually, they are constantly really stiff Couture, it is not every one of us, you know, I've been getting like 10 different models and see how fast do.

You know that was talking about it? I don't know how you feel. I feel like a community. I can meet you at the moment, must be one thing right there. Bring the adding making apps that use ATI, which is a value-add for us, you know? Maybe they pay us the use of.

Pants, okay? That's kind of thing for the community. I have not the right word for this, but if you imagine a hobbyist community that build birdhouses nerd out on building here where where people are excited about, what's an offer, they want to improve what what is there and and are part of the process, it's like a club.

I haven't got to the phrasing for that, but that's a particular emotion and emotional reward to be part of something and to be a big supporter thing.

And I think when when you look at this has been investor, it's a nice. It's nice to have at the beginning cuz it sustains the growth of the Community Field. They will always be the sphere of like, how scalable is This Will Destroy in the long run. I think that's that's a valid fear but you don't have to solve all that at the beginning of the section, very hard to not to this to begin with.

So yeah, the task is to figure out how to how to how to explain that coz what you described to me there is, is a couple of people who are Who are they were helping optimize and bringing the things that they would love to see in the the offerings for operations, and, and you are growing with this with this community, with their needs.

You're not having to go out there and put up a questionnaire and that's what people want their coming to you. Because we fully out and so often people won the future and they already implemented. So you make up a coffee if you want to fix, and then you

And, of course, a lot of people have the problem with that. You get a lot of magic of its own sometimes people think, okay? It's really great that we getting old, it's free kind of code contributions, but the overhead of checking and making sure it's good, it is quite high.

But I feel like agent a really a solution to that problem and Community magical kind of power of, of, of, of of, of of growing unit. 34 for the quality of your own repository is mediated through agents. Yeah. Well before we make a note to make sure everything is tested correctly and I think yeah.

And she would like some people that have you know that question of percentages, do you know that's kind of like what method test harnesses you you. So for example before we emerge and a branch that we have a test that check run each model with the modified. If it's kind of Incorrectly and taunt of community.

There's support from community members on building stuff. So you can ask question and then most of the time people will respond, right? Then says that the human aspect of community, take a part of something. The second thing is the community is is is is a technical community and they are contributing to the politicians architecture examples are updating code.

Recommending use the new model. Yeah, implementing hit before you use. The the, the third thing is that you are maintaining quality through through automation with AI agents and, and it's working well, so far I'm just looking at the most for request it so we can get those three things.

Okay. So I think that's just looking at that list of apps. Why are people using this API? This is no friction. Easy to install the EZ start. And then the the the the next step is when you want to develop further with you after you can go into a more consistent API experience by by signing up.

And then there's this Lowell, technical overhead Forever on building building on top of the nation's. You make it as easy as possible. And you share that point people stay because they off the community of the community. Has those three point before we should forget about another Point, that's very important for our usual.

Maybe, when we explained the right way to not scare investors, which is the fact that we we're giving even in the new system with with with their giving lessons quite generous. Okay. We're giving like tooth to a, to a regular user is not giving one part of the day, so that's that's

When we look at the number to be sending about 10% of that on average, you know, that we're giving 0.14 in per day on average per use. They don't do that so much and I don't know why you guys like, $300 food. It's like kind of an, if you and you can go through it.

Like verification process to get high. And I think what we could do

That allow users to sing, it takes a while before you apply except that, we just don't want to scare them thing. Like, I'm only working because we're giving away those for free, you know, what's with their Cadence? I would say it's like, you do everything in 5 days and then the free free stuff runs out.

This matches the Cadence in which people work when you create an app. Texas Discovery go profitable at this, at this level mention Google and a few others, their Target customer is is going for Enterprise, right? So that's where they make the most money. And I think that's a large growing audience.

That is out there. It's not going away. It's only going to get bigger of people wanting to make their own, this kind of obvious to to developers holding the craft.

This is what's being opened up right now. This sort of AI native Creator and who they are, what we are missing. I would say, both of these people. What you have to help with that is, is your list of apps that have been created. That helps a lot there.

A lot of information about each person in the guitar profile. To a lot of people put quite a lot of like effort and you can see what the Yeah. Yeah Yeahs. What's the demographic? Cuz we need to go. I made I like how an agent would like to take like I don't know.

Just $200 users to do I using IMEI and kind of find out what they have in common. Another interesting experiment I made with I'll take the one that page and see what sets them right now, but then we could do it if there's a passage to see if there is some correlation to them being as a cohort, a particular type of music but understanding why they're pays already answered.

Kind of gives you the the group in you need. Okay. I think that's good. So

Just to take a step back showing that list of of people building with formations is a good starting point. When you take the pictures anyways, you don't have that much time.

I think there is a fair still disappointed which that comes in at the Comfort. Inn in the compact. We will figure that out. You do you want to go over there? So we have two big screens and stuff.

By the way, just a question on the side because it's closed at the moment and I'm already feeling the light lunch. Do you want to set the idea of an amusing but it's quite another tournament.

Okay.

Okay.

Uses of China. Okay, did you?

the so,

I think.

You have gone to previous pictures, right? And think the recap be helpful to do in the past, with settings, pretty much covered already.

Three. Part of that I want to work on today. What is the what is this? Is just something very live here. You know how you could tell? You would say. It doesn't have to sound eloquent at this point and then this is the thing that's on coming back to each time.

Is where is the excitement which, which, which segues into, you know, where is the growth coming from? Bills on what this is. I was saying, you know, you're tough, what are they doing? What are you doing? How much is a growing in the Lost points. Because example sentences right?

You launch pollen for your existing users and is growing up, is what you have some numbers already but just the way of expressing you know, where that the growth is at its most exciting and And what I'm hearing from from here is like, there's this, this a few things to unpack.

One is there, there is. Devant 44, really easy to say. That's one thing when people are building, there is your case, they're staying because of the community Instinct thing. So we need to get into this a little bit. So I can, you know, what is driving all of them to why they doing it and and what do they get out of it?

I guess, we'll see yet what the one kind of what I've noticed in kind of packages when we were doing Angela until the flights confusion because we wasn't really naked totally clear. But I think we should do, which of the following we have like companies like replicates, right arm, like a, what's the one that ever lived in Europe?

Play area until an end. And what they are doing is they are making up with which you can create at the AI is principally. In does Ops 2. Code an app right under optimal, the interfaces for that. Actually, people are using that to, you know, that certain people have made, like, kind of like a wrapped, its Cloud offerings.

May I technology that people put into the accept it in the afternoon, flight difference. In the app, uses AI to make it as rapid as more people before cuz I know what the difference too clever and so on.

I'm just making stuff with the with a prompt on what you're doing is you're making it, you're making it possible for four people to Create a variety of different apps using the foundation additional models that are available and easy way of saying that is, if you want to make a photo app, you could do that.

And lovable lovable ask you to, to, to choose a bottle, which is all fine. And then, you know, the cost structure goes through lovable and nothing else. Are you going much 111 level deeper for people who want to create their own custom experience? They can use Paula Nations, who choose a bunch of five different photo with the best.

One is already getting confusing, right? Like okay. What's the difference?

It sounds like a maker mindset, right? So if you want to, why do people buy those little PC board? So I, what are they called? Again. My brain is not working. If you want to build a second right now, for light switch, you could buy off the shelf and Arduino which convened, extend it to, to all kinds of different capabilities and in some ways you are you offering this kind of Arduino has sex with your API.

So we have to come out translate that said that all the people have used the Arduino from educational reasons and it said schools to ride across to. I want to control my garage door my old way. And I I

Is it a waiting to happen and this is great unlock with AI. You're going broader than than than the dinner then, luvabulls and regrets and all that going to the deeper into into into space where people can experiment difference. Which is that if you make an app with lovable, you made it today.

I thought you asked, it's like so if you want or you want to let them know it'll be making game generator like you want to use them to be able to generate an avatar. If it is the kind of scaffolding to easily create the up with a, I would want the app itself needs to use a iWireless.

You you still need to connect to him. Napi, you know what I mean? Poop to two different apis apps in the future future. We'll have some kind of like the AI features run. The old Mentor experience is running in Europe. That's what we start if you frame the problem with all.

I want to see, I just want to bite in here.

The empty frame play, McComb Road close all apps in the future. All apps will need.

APK.

Feature.

Currently. Charlie.

You need to find it.

You need to mix and match.

by providing you solve this problem, which

Bethesda. Just saw this by providing.

What API?

Is access to all popular.

Yeah. He left my mother.

What a PA? What is? And developer. Develop a more popular.

I think this is the strongest points here.

22 build out and then the car status is it's fragmented complex.

I saw it scriptions onboarding test. Text Nicole.

Start. It's not in the military.

They start with one. Click economy with one line of code is really just like, you know,

writing apps. Easy to install. I didn't think like that. Like even if we just get the optimized say what you want to say. You know, this because I like all right now it's it's contextual, you know, for sure what you're doing.

Okay. This is a nice one because it gets away at least when he gets away from the idea of AI, native development is being right then and then Then we can, we can we can quickly move from something like this to the current excitement around this. Sup today. It's now 2026.

Why are people using pollination? I think this is

This is the two ways of doing this. You look at you. Look at the look at the what's available in the market, next to them. I don't like that cuz I think it's start from that point. You started from a more building community and and finding out what, what is the useful for this community are developing Go back to some of the older pictures of something to be gleaned from there cuz it's for 2nd go into these dishes cuz I still think there is something about how your credit say.

I started basically was powered by Google free free hours per day. Back in 2020, 29ft is how to use jupyter notebook Avenue you started off by making it easy for people to just start in the jupyter notebook, right? Just a simple was that huge has made it easy, I guess.

I mean,

That's like even kind of like that making these Technologies just a little bit more. Bring the huge influx of you. I've always been really surprised and I don't know how how how we say that the times we are building. It hasn't been very easy to Buggy and I will not say that that sounds of units coming distance between class

kind of like a core developer Community, if you are building right now and You need to go to someone else has happened with people who are not coming in as developers but as artists or Devils at home covid. So, you know, it's easy to find Discord but but still it's like they're they're coming on the basis of a recommendation that finding a community that is building a proficiency level right now, you have no Proficiency in coding.

There's a house there. How to Zone Hub starts and it's kind of it. It's a bit funny that situation cuz now we have the police assistant in his attachment to a little bit.

Make it easier for the community. And I think that's something that mean that you a community's great. Again, if you automate things too far, people just like a hooker.

You don't get the reactions of the in-between positive conversations, that make all this fun where people take the piss out of each other about the people's castration and how they solve their problems. Is that part of it brings people together and also helps lift you up in a way to to build your own thing but you also get back.

So I think there's one important thing and I think we really need to kind of Say that in a way, which is, I think we have a very select people really like a brand in the end, you know, and you see like what you see is that people come into the community saying, like, hey, I put this was free but it's a limited means of Defending a friend and I'd let you know the community around it.

I don't know exactly how to say it, kind of positive emptiness. You know, you can now pointing a agent at an existing webpage, insane, make a clone of that.

At the community. I think the community in the future will become much, much more important part of your mouth because because it's so easy to clone things with a I and I feel like we like maybe a year or two years away from really being able to clone any kind of difficult infrastructure.

And then it ended. Then I think what then becomes important is that you have a community which which is an enthusiastic, I don't know, what are emotes exist? It would be kind of interesting. So we have like when we go to the right place to talk about mode which is the biggest most of our adoption you know where things. Where you have a two-sided market and I think and then we get into another Point, okay?

That we have a kind of an obstacle, we can eat everything and we have a huge amount. Of apps that are Community has made, you know, how can I store things from you? But it is, isn't it is compute? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think I use has enough today would be paying us.

Wait, would be misleading is when people would you say app store go towards? You know, what you have in my phone, I got this thing where I pay money so then there is single as you sell a They need more compute. So you eat, we have an app store, the currency's compute community.

This. Yeah, we went to get into why there's a commitment. Not why there's Community. Why, why is this community so vibrant? Why is it growing? It's it's, it's a, it's a space where where people are are, are building. Yes, but it did something deeper here which is, it's just Did you create an easy starting point for love you?

Just you just talked about this earlier. It's like their complexity with with stocking and deciding Where which API Stands Tall, how much, and what the business models are for each one, whether you getting the right price points, you know, whether you need to subscribe to a program to get the right amount of paint.

Should I use it? A lot of complexity around that that you just take out. Just make it really simple and really cost-effective won prizes and gets you all the things you need. So, you know what you're getting. So that's that's, that's, that's helping grow the community. As you do, more people are, are, are building as old as your musical modes of Disappearing.

More people are building and you're just making it easier for them to to build AI features into their app. And the more this grows, the more this app community grows, you have to stay in the fact that you feel App Store where instead of currency exchange, because we have computer exchanging, and so will compute as the apps Chromo computer as more people built. More computers required for AI features as all technical V disappear.

So have all of his ass in a in a library that's a maybe like 30% open source repositories where you can like I want to make something like that, you know, you can just kind of plan it and then create your own version of it.

it's like someone has basically a socket to Graton you up, but Google photos. That doesn't just have these two kids that we were talking about today which multiplied which multiplied like how easy it is to start with pollination building a flywheel down, I think.

Is where is the excitement in the group? So okay. So I think What I'm trying to do a Down. Is.

is the paint, the picture, very good, simple picture of

Why this is growing right now. The wife throwing, I think it's down to a problem with the one. I think that's easy to grasp. His technical notes are disappearing. All this growth at 5 codeine by Kodak bill. O f require a i features that is really complicated 122. Then figure out what the right combination of apis from different providers are at which one to choose and at what price point to come out and and also you don't really have much room to experiment as you have to pay for most of them straightaway, you solve this by trading one, simple API.

That's all the most popular model. You have a, you have a tier where people can experiment with the other one there apps taking off. They can they can, they can convert into a they can take on a vacant a444 credits that gives them access to all of these models. I think that's the first thing.

So I can make a pretty big problem and this is only going to get. Bigger, is the size of the problem, I think you can. Express it through saying something like they're the most for building apps is is Vanishing. It's easier, but I think Jess is going to be easier to close.

Someone just made a clone of Casa de Fruta. Forget about it could be quite interesting for you, if you wanted to, we have a 2:00. We have to kind of bi-weekly call with Ankeny. So, can we go over there within half an hour? It's cool. What kind of stuff are you into today?

How late is it in Dubai?

I kind of like to, I like the Syrian kind of day that I could Syrian of y'all do too much cuz you always in there. Okay.

Did they have like a big buy one? Get one. Free promotion and do anything. You buy one. Get from freezing. I run. You see how they have to sleep. I like to get the bit. I get to B.

Wow, that's cool.

Brent.

Aunt.

You put that woman?

What's a good to give? Like, give them a little bit of an update. Like what what you could just find like a You are the closest address to fundraise. I guess we we working on the first version of the pics. Maybe we we could say, we want to have a If it's ready by finalizing it and practicing it this week.

And next, and to start reaching out with the earliest might be fed week and and so in parallel with the shortness of breath easier, access investors.

what would be an example like someone I called and raising times, you know, if you contacted from the Nations, so, I would say,

That's good question, who? I just got some interesting news.

It's all good memes.

So, you know, just organized by

Seattle state.

Pecan, whiskey.

The fact that I have to list allergies to stop with the local DC. Next, 2 weeks to see if it's out and empty and if anyone to take two bites and I will gather Tipsy, I wouldn't get into details names right now the list itself. They will probably send their list over to you.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I think, I think I have listed. I have like three maybe even five names for my previous kind of times, you know, can we contact? I think that it's a bit. Like, I don't know how they like to have a long list short list for the punch list everywhere, but I think it should be clear.

Is it worth going on with respect to me up? Now, I can Stop my eyes from the ice Detention Center.

Okay, so, yeah, so we have to go to the previous pitches what I wanted to to keep. So a framing of a problem solution, Got enough here to 210 destitute a one-liner. I think you had one question which I wanted to just which was like explain pollination to a meeting right now is simply is the company and yeah, that's fine.

That's fine.

so when you are pitching this, I would recommend use the brand pollination gif.

This question is, why do you split the two? I think for most Americans to be why, but I mean like it's like a symphony right? Like which is the most fit, it's just like we have alphabet company in their brand is Google, but the company has not called Google you know it and you'll see Imagining the future where you have different vertical.

Set fire to think what your vision is. And if your vision is to grow this Beyond media generation into solving curing cancer,

Play Disturbed coming from Alta. Falls is great while ago. I'm blessed because I was just in a lot of a lot of kind of parallels and do what we were just talking about.

This is kind of mollusk.

that's just so kind of more like generic

so she ignored the 4th bullet, so makes it look a little bit like black love about which I'm Yeah, we're in a factory. Maybe. We're okay, I'll Futures Advance. This is also not not relevant anymore. Advertisers not cuz I apologize compute computer. You make money from computer to phone has

And I think this is awesome in this is the point which we have not talked about that much yet, which is, and I think this is a very good strategy. Is that their use has become become a drug So, how'd it work? Cuz it's quite hard to imagine how apt user to come to a customer.

I mean, I think they may be the closest, what's the closest? I can give you an example on Google, you know, using Google Cloud infrastructure and then you also, Allow users to log in through Google you know that Google Google is providing both infrastructure and also order of your app customer has become Google's customer storage and especially photo apps, right?

And then when you have to wear The uses of the app have to use all the nations for some reason that's bringing new user. So you are making a game but with teeth we have this life Roblox Naruto. It's the whole ecosystem.

It's basically the same thing but playing the games on Roblox much larger than the amount of developers. That's where I really that crazy bro with their uses

cute Caesars Pizzas by Paolo Conte ologies feature to

yeah, that could be

The compounding effect of cake. Do you have any evidence of that at the moment and we can, I think we're going to roll this out now we can have the number to the yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Public way to use of roots. That would probably give those users, like a smaller.

View a new category of using pictures on another page. No. And if I haven't thrown up an account yet, then he died from the guy that wants to type. The kind of needs the login, and I'm going to Friday, I could use a, I was more technical be Tuesday room. Tell you what, what did work with it than I do.

Can I see as far as I know, it was the big idea until Google and Facebook took over log in. And this is, this is this is Mother and they've written it down down, quite quite quite nicely.

fundraising, when you have, when you have examples,

I think it shows excitement, where's the excitement and the and you have it already is what's in that list, you showed me that your personal story, why you doing this and what the vision for probably the most important, everything else I'm not there, but who are you? Why you doing this then?

Are you the person we should back from Lex and Batman fries and stuff that it's good to arrive in play computer games on your phone?

I would have just not talk to you would probably ever wanted something so easy but this is like the first like declaration of war the back, okay?

Why are you doing this? What's the best? What's 16 kasim in 7. Minutes are the core with antler. Throw it out of musically.

I mean, look. I'm like the time I've been, like, I've been like, before popular, you know, I've been, I've been hurting since I've been, like, 15 years old. You know, I started a high-end computer science. I had. Like, that's like, since the age of 16 I've been into a i and, and, and I've been kind of, I've been working in the big companies such as Amazon and Sun Microsystems very early on and I bought and I be I've been very fascinated with kind of community building.

Like I I've built like large communities in The Intern.

Fascination with the technology in the deep understanding of the technology together with like a desire to build community and a few times, like, in Brazil I made with we built our Arts Collective, where which had like hundreds of thousands of followers with parties. I'm I'm quite good at Naturally, kind of making something that people come to organically, you know, I don't need marketing.

What I do kind of spots, the imagination of other people and I very strongly started. Embracing the very strongly sings without me.

Optimizing something together and I've been kind of following how much like him. Cuz I started replacing close to meet with natural. That we have a winter and so I was working with a I but before it went into became fashionable, like, let's say, 9 years ago, when I was working together.

The first time for free pictures with General Motors, like with the image models before anyone was even aware that they were

I feel like yeah. And now it's all coming together.

Specialized University. I think that I do not support absolutely nothing. Since I've been in the game for so long. I see, I feel like I see more macro-trends than other people. You know how it is, but I see, I think I feel like with my predictions. What's about to go down into what you saw a problem?

I mean this is challenges Financial, right? You have to have to find ways to teach getting use different businesses. When you have, it's a cheap part of this back story that ends and you need a credit card in most cases due to get boxes. The thing you wanted to do now is as more as you see more people young people getting into, you see the same issues again, crazy, you want to stall fit, you want to make it easy for anyone to build a build for the future.

Where anyone, if he even biohackers

And I mean defeat a quote from Alan and someone is Doctor. They really love to hear the biggest fish never listed in. Yeah, yeah yeah yeah.

and okay, let me just

It would be nice if they would kind of join the conversation.

Has to be the parrot, Polly want a cracker.

Do you like to come?

Thanks. We've just been talking about how great. My background is not going into this meeting for the confidence.

Want to ask one, maybe.

Like no one that's on time. If I could

Hi. Was last year was nice guy. Flemish bunnies, neon to Zona.

Yeah, then Holly coffee can happen to him.

Yeah, and I can just get with me. I always turn up unannounced at the office instead somewhere Providence.

embracing the fact that we need to do fundraising and until we can work Monday, after Spider-Man gets fight in school,

Did any of that matters. Maybe I'm going to list the phones at Walmart shopping list of list of 10 Berlin, want to get money to buy. The flags are technically a medium. Gomez has played in

Yeah. Yeah. It's the I think where we are right now, cuz it's January 1st week and then on what exciting with where the company is now a nail that down. So we're even spend a couple of hours on that today. It's not a fortnight I think in 72 weeks does the goal we were aiming for pushing for us to start reaching out to a short list of what I would call like closer investors around us that are talk from 2 to 83 and to test the pitch out with them and get feedback and then maybe time sheets from some of them before going to the more exciting and faster.

So that's this month. February would be would be the the more exciting on that list. So that's where we are now.

But I didn't want to get to do. You know, these people ready to direct relationships with others? Will need some connections to. So I think when we get close to the time, we should check in with you and see if you already have relationships with them. And I know.

So, I'm pretty sure you got your own list of contacts, right? So we could, we could maybe in the next week next week or so Richard, like what? What I'll pitch is and who you think those investors are there? Is that you've seen that? I felt like it was time to really take a fresh look at it and just drill down to where the excitement is in this cuz it's quite a lot of different parts when you look at it from a technical perspective.

But for me, the The thing that's exciting that that is still as this community of Builders and end, how fast is growing. The fact that people are paying for these services that we haven't found a way to describe that. So then once we have that we can we can we can think about which investors would be interested in this. I mean, what we usually don't do with the down to get up with you and have a major brainstorm on which you should be unprepared, from your investor is going to miss, you think are relevant.

What's the direct connection to the connection to them? That would be great. Otherwise we'll we'll see if direct contact makes sense. What is exciting into the story? The Narrative. That's what working on today and we should have this ready within a fortnight at the latest. So we can begin contacting investors.

That's the that's the rough time line now and we'll have a better idea unlike like the fix still of dates of when we want to go out of this within the next week and a half. I would imagine. Yep.

My friend recommendations to Tia date on. This is the date that's already before last

Taking meetings, 16 best Jukes in the first in the first 2 weeks post-op days. So you know, from the first day she has to reach out to investors. We know who would be receptive to know, you might want to call them to you to tea at 3 to pitch in front of them.

So, you know, when you say do everything you want to go, are you saying do the tutu and tiara ones in one go. Somebody has to do it in such a way that You schedule the First full days or something. If you're more practice feces, and then like 2 days after.

But I would But he reads. I think you need to brush up on the phone though. If this drags out too much, then become super hot to build a dynamic. Okay. Okay. I see, I see where you're coming from. Modesto to to use those calendar as the as the means to organize that the dates,

also, if the

Put the deck behind of sharing link. Then you kind of keep it up today just kind of silly stuff. Then by the time I just want to see you a question like that. I didn't based on this I would say we'll have to pitch ready to be tested between us in in fortnite.

OK. And then and then we we work on this. This plan. As as you discuss maybe it is the 15th of going out with the with the with the investors within within three weeks at the latest, but not to the tier-1 list but due to sickness, but let's just told him as this in 1 and 2/3 within the first few days and then build up to the to the to the, to the rest of them, within a 2, to 4 weeks.

Something like that is what I'm what I'm hearing. So what we can commit to Thomas, if you dream is the cyclists have this already with him within a fortnight, ready to go, kneeling down. What's exciting is where we're at right now, and, and articulating. That's in a way that is exciting.

I realize. Like a lot of things I could, could explain that to him down a bit, is kind of catchphrases, you know, that I don't kind of. Yeah, that's why. I was looking at the cover, very kind of player that said, I don't know, you said a very clear way of like I'm describing comes with practice. Are you so like how we, how we position ourselves?

I could, if we say it's in one way, then people say hi, you're just like lovable making it very clear, what we are and what makes it special. I guess that's

I'm praising deck that I shared with you and we can go, let's go through it and why we raised where you don't share that yet but where you go out to eat and then I think that is super Super Bowl.

You're not going to get to 60 meetings within the space of two weeks, other than just being lovable and having to do anything and being competitive. Anyway, so what in your portfolio, you have a range of companies with different valuation based on what they're doing in the mind working, assumption is where this might change in 2 weeks ago, but my working is sumption to go to the guys who has been looking to raise something around 3 million with, with a valuation of around 12, a pre pre pre 12 is this, I'm not in touch with what the numbers are nowadays.

And I'm just wondering, you know, what you would would would say is is is for a seed Stage Company in this space and then In the last week, they've launched Paula and it's growing people are paying. I think you've already end and B, we are by no means when it to it up for it.

But but yeah. The question I'm asking is you do when you you know, politicians from the accelerator days and you know, you haven't an idea of, you know, where they want to go, and then you'll start seeing what what people are paying for companies right now. So if if we're raising a thank you, thank you.

This kind of level send type of investors as the type of investor list your building out. So my question is the first round is it something in the range of 3 million with a 12 million tree? Is that what companies are getting around here at the moment. And for

I think Mister simplify it was only discuss the number to be raised because ultimately at this stage, population is a function of the mouth brace. Effective range is between 17 to 22%.

The moment that you raised more than a million, your ultimate being a dynamic where you have somebody for them, for pricing, the round, even lesbians from it. Ends up being a convertible and that's the right number because that moved get up to the following fraction of markets and want to be spending all kind of engineering and then we expect it to be with into the evaluation.

You are kind of strangers and price around the question. How much can you raise the shades.

I think. Is mostly. Determined spy. Grossmont more than sex. At this stage because you're not raising on the strength of the team because raising experience Founders or raising on traction. And then traction is a backwoods.

I think it's mostly a backwards calculation a

Somebody who invested feed is looking to. Four indicators that this company within 18 months. Is at the yard stake at which this year has a cab. So that means

20 KL on growing 30%. Every month most X growth. And if you are more or less happy motivation, which is the case that we have with our nation's today based on monetization that the motivation is far from anything that looks exponential at least by the next numbers that I've seen, maybe I'll survive, but that's why you need to show.

The. so, I think that is Ultimately and in the absence of monetization, I mean the university. Also receives pre-revenue. Then I just need to have that robustness in the adoption and in the World Cup. That's more. Sorry, that's the case. I think. Let's have a look at the numbers.

I think I 3 million. Eaves. Is a stretch unless the numbers have changed significantly, since when we last looked at it, I think beginning of December.

I think. What a typical seed round Sia in the ecosystem. 2/ / 4 million, tree seeds.

1.5 on Woods. I think you need to my guess is Rob, I can look at the numbers but my guess would be that. You have a better chance. Raising. in the 1.5 to 2.5 range stand in the 3 million + range

Candlewood bait for me. I think it would be quite interesting yet, and to also kind of like, have different number like that. So, that's it for now on. And I use a gross, what, you know what, I look like, because we could also like it kind of gives us motivation was such a kind of, we have different that I kind of livers, you know, which we can use to increase traction and sign up and yeah, but it don't make sense to me what you're saying?

Adjust address of the adjuster about the numbers of what we've done now. And I just had a link in the in the chat. So we moved to weekly kpi. We started like like you know, if we have a legacy Sabbath which didn't have light which was basically completely free.

You couldn't even pay for it if you want it. We had a very good traction with. And now, basically, what we've done is, we started from zero because I knew a new API, by the new sign up and so on. And I think that actually helps us because we can show these.

Like, if you, if you look at the numbers, would you have quite an impressive month of a user growth and also you know, but I do I looking a bit of court in the last. Last time we met, we, we we, we, we will train ride that thing that we're getting down and and I think like starting like this, some potential. Screen new funnel which I found really interesting.

So the homepage you can probably share the screen on that sign ups getting tied up into into pollination is now a function of the homepage if you want to see generate images on some of the more expensive models, you have to click on that model and it takes you to sign up immediately.

This is still a bunch of free stuff. So people come to the sites are things that are at the choir YouTube to open up an account with politicians to be able to use it. I think that's driving some of your growth right. So that you can allow their users to log in through pollination.

The uses of the apps have their own like balancing for the nation's. We haven't ruled that out yet. A lot of interest. Future and I do see that this could push to track changes in terms of use a sign ups, quite significantly because the number is much higher than the number of optical office.

You know, like if you look at ROBLOX you have a question of a huge amount of people who are making games but the people who are playing the games a much larger, a right and a strategy that is. We haven't even really haven't even tapped into that yet and that would be one of these like growth hacks.

You know where if we if we roll it out that scenario where we have not I think right now we're having like 600 user signing up a day. This could be a 10 times that I think of course I could be too optimistic and I'm just saying that week that I cannot power to Kind of the people.

And I don't see it very much, but it's it's kind of use that pays models. In the end. You can use like that they are a creative, can offer like maybe the cheap model limited models for free, but then they have two options, right? Either? They could create their own payment system, they could create that they could just like integrate that ended up their use of pace with the poem credits on party Nations. And yeah and then of course, like people who want to make an up and monetize it and it doesn't really help them, you know, because they are bringing that uses to us.

But we have such a large amount of let's say, it's kind of a destiny that to even thinking about money, they just want to have a cool app that many people are using and then just give them the possibility that their users pay, you know, and potentially as a millions of users

How did we clean the right thing? I'm in the Deep, looks like. They lost 4 weeks. Look like the beginning of an exponential trench. It's going to be well in my dude, I thought it'd be a nice thing to have, but it turns out that people actually want to Get to get credits.

It's one of the reasons that I think we went through this before so I'm just sharing this openly. It's just the guys that do we get a cost to it? So it's quite competitive to what they're offering for $1 1 Poland, 1 Falls, get to 5000 images.

That's it, that's it. That's an easy thing for the space right now. So so that's working quite well. And it also because of the low-barrier to just pay for it. Thursday, got three different ways of paying for it. You attract a larger pool of people for particular from countries where we're paying with credit cards.

Might be an issue if the payment from starting to see. Let's see, two weeks what we're seeing a pattern around this, but at the moment is doing that and I think the discussion starting from zero. I think you had some good numbers already in revenue from the first week at least 10 by mistake.

I think it's okay. If you look at the last the last week and the week before you see that you let me see a good friend that that one thing, which we know it's thing, which is quite a lot of like the drop-off from people who reach our checkout page to actually going through with the payment advice is very high with trying to figure out why that is, like, of course, has a lot of stuff that can be optimized still that we're not, we're not accepting more kind of payment methods yet, so we're trying to figure out how can we improve the conversions?

What what kind of knife is that like it's we have to follow, you know? If it's not any more like in theory people will pay and maybe but you know, we kind of weakness in its know, we know we can bring in more you. That's so I'm I'm very, like, excited in this moment.

I do think like, we can transmit this excitement to to investors and hopefully the numbers without their show.

Answer the next time when you have unless the target list and DEC ready for and let's do that. So timelines what is the is a fortnight at the latest supposed to be flying back from Italy and just plain got some of that cuz it's no stuff today. Thank you for your interest.

We'll talk more in a couple of weeks.

Delicatessen.

Noncommittal. Oh my God.

I like to lick a shared, you've lost it. That's funny. Kind of like what I was doing reverse engineering. The other picture of a kind of like almost a mathematical approach where he has written some articles about like kind of like analyzing Trends in like which companies get good cookies are you need to understand you arrange and like how people thinking about it.

I think you're one thing about you guys that I'm notice what it is. This time I just get lucky, I don't know why.

It's a somewhat uncanny.

Wanted me to do it.

I didn't say goodbye.

What does a positive?

Turning at the Laura has a violation.

Just about to pull up.

Look at the set company.

The money is Sissy.

Already.

If they're going to be appointment for tomorrow.

The target is to go pretend 250k. You going to be

look at this week's to prioritize. About to get like longer-term objectives.

So, I can come back from this point.

You know what?

This point of view is really.

OK, Google

I didn't read that text.

Buddy's Furniture.

What's up?

Cuz I believe.

Empire. He's going to put.

What is the? What may be useful? I don't know yet.

I'm more than that. I can get this application to Noah.

So, you eat all her food?

so,

so, when it comes to your story, there's the This is who you are, the problem you're trying to solve know why it's so important to you when you get into the next day which is like the second division of where this is going, I think there is you can presented, you know, I threw some ideas about what other people will be doing with with with with bottles and why didn't he why?

The need for confused is not going the way you can spend a lot of stories around that going into things like drug Discovery and seek with this pitch at the end of it. And this is where it's going to short trip. Is going to be so complicated.

Simple types of fine shooting so maybe music it'll come out that you could find soon music model to particular style and you are like, like massive, whatever you find a sound, you like a from that. And then you make an instrument for yourself a nice. Nice, nice. Nice, nice, nice.

What is biting yet? Because mentioning the requirements of an infrastructure, which we could use the painting is for taking them off, and making it customizing, it's for your stupid.

We're not watching a speech-to-text text-to-speech. You can upload you off your sample of your own voice to a male voice to clock in the populations of the model list of create your own versions of the ones. I can take this, kind of generic text speech to have statical openai voices, you know, and I can upload my voice and then give me the name and then.

And then I can access this Model Model. T machine learning and someone who doesn't

Maybe that's the trend has something to do to latch on to Zurich this quarter, we going to see customizing of the bottom growth area and we're building into that right now getting to to this hospital has a two Leaf evil with his in. This is what's coming up. I think that's great.

I really think it's a good thing that I mean because like basically they made a place where everyone we're doing a part of that but not not, we're not exactly hugging face. You're different. But it is going to come up. You know what's the difference to you and no efforts?

No. Maria still has a while this is right at some point.

Boats disappearing. Everyone's going to everyone is building 32 complicated fragmented. Important thing to stress is no barrier to start a physical model. So usage, base model trees. Where was providing 6%?

Then you know you owe you if you have time just people who have to set the you usually have to set the subscription price. So if you max out your subscription and then trying to make it to the thing with the pain. I didn't because because a lot of people tell you that your your business model meets your uses where they are and you are leading the way in Yeah, you have to just four for the more experienced. Foreclosing vets Avicii store in the domain, the comparisons with with the the other API providers aggregators will come up more.

And I think that there is this thing that we just worked on here has has the ingredients to the positioning of pollen pollination agency over or what's your building are important. That puts you over there if you don't have it right now, what are you building right now?

Is it really a disadvantage? Because in the end light grows in certain way, back to the boats disappearing, everyone can build AI features that helps a lot because I think, for people who are not their daily job is not building apps, right? And they know a lot about developers, they no hugging face and all that they would see this as as as a futile attempt at trying to be hugging face two.

Unless you, you changed the parameters around how big this can be and leave the way to do that is to say the technical books are going to go to Krista clone in our little community.

Oh yeah. So it's presenting that this is growing now is is quite good cuz you can have it but I think there's room for a ride to get acquired which is what they going to be betting on that you came into our community and Polly. Dave and it's like a whole another one which is like and then like a ducted it to run directly with pollination.

Yeah. Well you know you going to see more more people coming in who don't have we don't use car still but I'm looking for directions more like a lovable flow, maybe cuz it's a bit mom we played and Lavagirl I think it's just 2026. You have this Mass adoption of of of lovable replayed, all these things, people stop building apps.

So that means the next step will be moving away from us. It's just like going away from the US that they give you going into like deep into like you want something customized for you. You know how to build an exit right now. I will have a dictation app that I built is uses 11.

Louds uses open API, whisper it. So I thought it to be multilingual and now there's a better way to do this with one API that covers my needs, and then I'm not paying three different providers for it makes sense. Now, there are three CC, I think that's where there's a lot to the community cast, you know, which kind of encoding, a AI coding.

the technologies that I made a research last week, which is Manual. Do you know? It needs to voice to real time. You can flip them into everything, The Voice live code on the phone, and that's what's going to be the next thing. And so far, you use the voice model.

That was pretty good to have intrigued at 2:30. You can even tell if you hold it up with your MCV.

Roblox Studio death to you. Now, if you wanted to know if, you know, yeah, it works for you because you have your own space. But if you're in a co-working space if it doesn't, he's at work enough with with very like a no or must not talkin you know. He's already one step ahead.

Elon Musk.

I think we've got enough here for now and everything else. We can do online and in Discord but there was one last thing which I wanted to get into which you, which I already seen like five wings from Elliot if you described with the end, posten parston through check, check openings are always going to be you, like, why are people doing why is it growing?

So right now, you're, you're bringing his legacy uses people are, are what building apps have a new model to do this.

Get a more clear understanding that you can communicate with why someone is coming in and why they're using the best guess, but in a convincing way there now quickly credit cards not like everyone B. Mmm, the fact is that the cost of course I need to get them to make apps that can be commercialized today. The Weeknd. Make some revenue from from their apps, I think so I think there's a lot of talent to develop but they don't really have the opportunity to express their talent because they were taking away the trash.

Psychological easy to use a commercial low-cost or easy, easy to handle. And then social is the community aspects of those three things. Maybe it's three, three topics in of which country which to maintain its. There's a map for each one and and whatever it is.

If this discussion Ronnie metrics is why people coming over the someplace. People are looking for ways to use the experience to build apps that come up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And and I think that's, that's a good one. Also made me feel so harder to travel for jobs for the countries and outright, that's another thing. not too sure when you cut this funnel of people coming to the theater homepage and generating images for free and then converting,

that means to feel less random. That's all I think it's just like what the intent is growing. Why is he growing? It's coming from Discord is the amplifier, right? I would I would pick it up.

so, we need to get our stars stars, Trust that works good whatever you call that I've been plus just scored for the stars of the report mentioned in that wall that used to use published yet

Yeah, that's great. That is great cuz that is the one thing that most people you're talking to would not have experienced of a thing that's hot too. Hot to for them to snap your fingers around, but they loved it weird that we have, you know, when I look like, when I'm talking to provide guidance, to give us credit, you know, that's the what's what, what is and explain 100 now or something, where they just, they just couldn't take some credit from from, you know, they have a smoke and then they make a kind of an API Gateway.

What makes a difference is that we have this community and ostriches, Yeah, these people are sharing the things they create on pollinate. Your kind of customer spaces on hugging face that Community. Here, you have to go out your training apps that go into app, ecosystem for mobile app.

And you're forced to stay in the described with like turning the user to customer put the the difference. I guess we'll be with you in the strictest with the a gaming app that requires a user to generated image. You provide the architecture for that the computer. Or if it has a scale easily that you just upload that to the user, they they just buy a credit and the credit goes through.

Mickey's our knowledge she would help if you get interrogated on that on that X avoid. All these questions is I think the token usage, the token token in took it out total overtime. Pretty sure this is doing. I think that just that I think this is what's happening Loganville

And I think at that point you can always if you have time to talk about the Roblox case study, I think, I think we can also get that there's a few of the death that I wasn't paying attention to channel anymore with a few of the best reached out to me have been fired years under with appearances and I think we control the believe, we are, we should we, we shouldn't abandon them.

I think we can get. These Custom Custom Custom customizing bottles.

Can you stream for you? Cuz you don't have to buy pollen if we get traction, more traction again, in in Roblox and feel really quite excited. Internally about people being able to buy a farm with Robux directly that looks like a complicated last time, we looked at it, it's just more user experience rather than what's happening the back probably conversion to real event.

It's not abandoned. You have to focus on building out the payment system have a bit of time to, to build out those game ideas. I talked about in the next few weeks. So So maybe something good comes out of that TV show like yours, like the kids that people can use for example and and things right there.

No. But it's coming and you already had some early signs of good traction on on Roblox that kids games being built on it. This time of last year's went up some of this year. What is this going to look like? If you have a full payment system in place for for this and you can scale with you, use it. well, if you can meet your users about

so let's pause on the pitch for now, I think just given its 34 flip to turn our attention to artifact and see if they've

they're still accepting applications.

But accepting late applications application form, still open.

Okay, I just have to write the article. I think what I think we can do this, very easy to anything. Is this the second video now? I'm like kind of like things when we talkin about picture and and having a meeting with a little bit until the morning, put a little bit of fire on this because because I am just worried.

Looking for five more teams if we get everything ready by tomorrow afternoon we can do to text today and then we just saw the video. I posted a video tomorrow spective like boots. Yeah, if you want to try and fill in the online and it's just this is the bit of what you do your life story of your back.

So yeah, that's like what are you building in before? You got some interesting stuff? You can you can share the kpi.

Screenshot screenshot. Just send Kayden is growing like crazy. So that's why I asked if you had a 2-0, sorry, you can spend 10000 but like I think the more impressive than the number is the fact that like when you look here

Wishing this thing this year. So like in the last week or the week before, when you in one week, I just put it in there and saying this is all traction and take away. What's like 6070? We're seeing. We should our first After to take it off first.

From zero, where you're going to get to Matthew career of you and all this kind of things, you know, they'd give me some hints, the light healthy the link, maybe it's just the other project project and easy. There's one pill with says you have a team members and and then you can send a link to Elliot.

I don't think you need to make that a dependency that I leave before they set up a. You can just send it off and then and then

219 members does the founder. Stick it on to all free product. There they just they just starting to build something in his, they're excited about, it's for you this tonight, I would my sweat it. We'll try some more some more

What's really nice about this grant? Or I tried already one Supply to it is or the credits. What do you get with them? You know, which is great for us. Replicator.

Read electrical as well, workout.

Complexity. Okay, okay, so let's finish the physical part of a meeting. Now, I'm going to head back if you could Go to this form.

Go to this form. It looks fairly straightforward, just go through it and see what you want to add, a thing that's in the metrics. Already the video If you don't feel like it right now, but I think what I can do the next hour or so you looking over exactly what I'll do is get back of the backstory that may help you just in terms of like story arc for 60 seconds.

Cuz it's really just about you. And yeah, I think what you can do here is to you and why this thing is the fourth video for like, okay, so you could start with the problem is called here which is making it easy for anyone to build. So I don't know if you have this job.

So you need to think about this the one where you need to say that because of because it's it's a lot of good product.

Winner of product of life and being what it is. That's always a plus. When you talk about the product, you should ended with and we've got to make it to be made and just your numbers to get get people excited to show that is growing in the last week when we just launch.

We got down two men inside of some the thing of something like this. Just thought I would say the last 10 seconds like to talk about the traction, right? In the last week. If you remember it but if you don't don't worry about it, okay? Just student of Life, what you're excited about. Yeah, I'm sure you've got stuck.

Okay. So I will go to the back story and vision that what we talked about just spill it down to some story arc. That might be helpful for the video about for you. Tell a bit about yourself treated his practice. Yeah, yeah. What do you use for transcribing audio.
