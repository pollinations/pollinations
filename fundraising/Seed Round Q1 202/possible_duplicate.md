Pollinations Strategy & Fundraising Meeting - Jan 7, 2026
🎯 Core Value Proposition
The Problem
Technical complexity: Building AI apps requires navigating fragmented APIs, multiple providers, different pricing models, subscriptions
High barrier to entry: Most AI APIs require credit cards, signups, and complicated onboarding
Growing demand: As "boats disappear" (coding barriers vanish), everyone will build apps requiring AI features
The Solution
One simple API → access to all popular AI models
No friction start: One line of code = generated image (no signup required)
Usage-based pricing: Pay only for what you use ($1 = 5000 images)
Unified access: Text, image, speech, video models through single endpoint

📊 Growth & Traction
Current Metrics
~600 users/day signing up
Weekly revenue growing (started from zero with new payment system)
Token usage trending exponentially (last 4 weeks)
Conversion challenge: High drop-off at checkout (payment method limitations)
User Journey
Discovery → Free tier, no signup, instant results
Experimentation → Limited free usage sufficient for prototyping
Conversion → Sign up when they need consistent compute/premium models
Retention → Community support + low switching cost makes staying easier than leaving
Why Users Stay
Factor
Description
Psychological
Easy to use, familiar, low cognitive load
Commercial
Low-cost, competitive pricing, flexible payment
Social
Active community, Discord support, shared knowledge

————————
👥 Community as Moat
Three Pillars
Human Support: Questions answered by community members, not just docs
Technical Contributions: Community updates code, recommends models, implements features
Quality Automation: AI agents + test harnesses maintain repo quality from community PRs
Community Dynamics
Hobbyist energy: Like birdhouse builders nerding out together
Emotional reward: Being part of something, supporting growth
App ecosystem: 100s of apps built, open-source examples to clone/remix
User → Customer flywheel: App users become Pollinations users (Roblox model)

Incorporate feedback, refine
Feb onwards
Approach tier 1 investors

Target Raise
Amount: $1.5M - $2.5M (stretch: $3M)
Dilution: 17-22% typical at seed
Valuation: Function of amount raised
Key metric needed: Show path to Series A indicators (20K MRR, 30% MoM growth)
Pitch Structure
Who you are - Background, why you're the one to build this
Problem - Fragmented AI APIs, complexity, barriers
Solution - One API, all models, no friction
Traction - Growth charts, user numbers, revenue start
Vision - Where this is going (customization, fine-tuning, etc.)

🚀 Artifact Accelerator Application
Details
Program: Founders Inc. Artifact
Offer: $250K + $500K in credits (Replicate, etc.)
Status: Still accepting late applications
Deadline: ASAP (looking for 5 more teams)
Application Components
	☐	Online form (straightforward)
	☐	60-second video pitch
	☐	Team info (can add Elliot later)
	☐	Metrics screenshot (show growth trajectory)
Video Structure (60 sec)

🔮 Future Vision
Near-term
User-as-customer conversion: App users pay with Pollen credits
Roblox integration: Kids buying Pollen with Robux
Long-term Positioning
Custom model fine-tuning: Upload voice samples → get personalized TTS model
Not competing with Hugging Face (model hosting)
Not competing with Lovable/Replit (app building)
Unique position: The compute layer for AI-native apps
As barriers disappear: More builders → more AI features needed → more compute
