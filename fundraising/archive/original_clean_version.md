# Personal Story & Vision - Clean Version
**Updated**: January 20, 2026  
**Duration**: ~90 seconds total (60s story + 30s vision)

## 📖 PERSONAL STORY (~60 seconds)

**Part 1: The Beginnings (~15 sec)**
- Obsessed with AI as teenager — coding games, gravity simulations at 13
- Top university for AI — graduated top of class
- Published peer-reviewed paper on neural networks
- *(Only if asked: simulating how ants navigate, also did AI car racing)*

**Part 2: Big Tech + Community (~15 sec)**
- Hired straight out of university by Amazon as AI engineer
- Also built grassroots creative community (Voodoohop, 9 years in Brazil)
- **Key line**: "I've seen how community and collaboration works — both in corporate AI and grassroots organizations"

**Part 3: The Problem + The Fix (~20 sec)**
- Saw the same issues everywhere — walled gardens, fragmented APIs, talent locked out
- Any developer starting now faces the same barriers I did
- Built Pollinations — what I wished I had at 16
- One line of code, no signup, instant AI

**Part 4: Proof - It's Working (~10 sec)**
- 600+ developers signing up daily
- 1,000+ apps in the ecosystem
- **Best example**: Teenager built Roblox game → 51M visits, $12K first month

## 🔮 VISION (~30 seconds)

**The Opportunity**
- We're at an inflection point — more people creating apps than ever, from 6-year-olds to senior home managers
- But there's a problem: dev builds app → goes viral → owes OpenAI $5K → kills innovation

**Where We're Going**
- **End state**: A mycelial network of millions of AI micro-apps, all powered by our infrastructure
- **Our position**: We're not a foundational model company. We're the open access layer — permissionless, interoperable, community-run
- **The moat**: Technical moats are disappearing. Our advantage is community multipliers:
  - Dev kits and starter templates
  - 13K+ Discord helping each other
  - Gamified tier system that rewards builders
  - Network effects: AI models recommend us, apps bring more apps
- **Framings**: "OpenID for AI" (technical) / "Roblox for AI" (gaming/consumer)

## ⚠️ KEY REMINDERS

### Do's ✅
- **"Talent locked out"** resonates better than "credit card barrier"
- Peer-reviewed paper establishes credibility early
- Be snappy — bang, bang, bang, impress them fast
- End story with concrete proof (Roblox game)
- Vision should feel inevitable, not aspirational

### Don'ts ⚠️
- Don't mention specific years (age bias)
- Don't drop university names — just say "top university for AI"
- Don't dwell on details — just hit the beats
- Don't repeat metrics between story and vision

---

## 🎯 TRANSITION FLOW

**Story → Vision transition:**

After Part 4 (proof), pause briefly, then:

> "This is just the beginning. We're building toward [vision]..."

This creates a clear break between:
- **Story** = Your journey + current traction (it works NOW)
- **Vision** = Where this is all heading (the FUTURE)

## 📝 ALTERNATIVE: COMBINED 60-SECOND VERSION

If you only have 60 seconds total, compress to:

**Story (40 sec)**:
- Obsessed with AI as teenager → top university → published paper
- Amazon AI + built creative community (Voodoohop)
- Saw talent locked out everywhere — built what I wished I had at 16
- Proof: 600+ devs/day, teenager's Roblox game hit 51M visits

**Vision (20 sec)**:
- Building the open access layer for AI — not foundational models, the infrastructure
- Mycelial network of millions of micro-apps
- Moat is community: dev kits, gamified tiers, network effects
- "Roblox for AI"
