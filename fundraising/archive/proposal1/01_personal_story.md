# 1. Personal Story
**Why you are doing this (how you got here with Pollinations, pain points you noticed, backstory)**

---

## Act I — Obsession

I grew up obsessed with AI before it was cool. As a teenager, I wasn't chasing hype—I was chasing understanding, tinkering with models and systems to see how they could extend human creativity.

I found myself immersed in the world of artificial life and genetic algorithms, fascinated by the idea of simulating life-like processes with code. Creating systems that could learn and adapt was a thrilling challenge.

My father, a steadfast advocate of scientific skepticism, instilled in me a rigorous approach to understanding the world. His influence ensured that my explorations were always grounded in critical thinking and empirical evidence.

## Act II — Mastery

This obsession led me to specialize in AI at university, where I graduated top of my class from Edinburgh University studying Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence.

My formal entry into AI studies happened in the early 2000s—a period often referred to as the "AI winter." Funding was scarce, and progress seemed to have stalled. Despite this, I was drawn to the field, intrigued by the potential of machine learning and the questions it raised about the nature of intelligence.

I then entered the most advanced AI and big-tech environments (Amazon AI), working on the inside of the machine. This work culminated in published research: "Evolving a Neural Model of Insect Path Integration" (Haferlach, T., et al., 2007, Adaptive Behavior).

## Act III — The Brazil Years & Creative Exploration

After settling in São Paulo, Brazil for 9 years, I founded Voodoohop—an influential art collective celebrated by São Paulo's art scene. I conceived and implemented a variety of interactive installations, combining my passion for art, research, and technology.

This period opened doors to more mystical perspectives, challenging my previously held notions and introducing me to the profound interconnectedness of life. My music fuses minimalist electronics with the chaotic rhythms of Latin America and the calculated trippiness of Krautrock.

## Act IV — Friction (The Pain Points)

While I loved the developer culture inside great tech companies, I saw the same broken pattern everywhere for the outside world:

- **Access was gated by credit cards** and corporate signups
- **APIs were fragmented and complex**
- **Builders were wasting 90% of their time on infrastructure** instead of ideas
- The people most capable of building the future—indie devs, creative coders, "vibe" coders—were **locked out by cost and complexity**

---

## Act V — Insight

I realized that while AI was becoming foundational infrastructure, the **on-ramp was broken**. 

It wasn't just a tooling problem; it was a **compute distribution problem**.

After returning to Germany, I completed a project researching the future trends of Artificial Intelligence for the World Government Summit. This gave me a global perspective on where AI was heading—and who was being left behind.

## Act VI — Inevitability (Pollinations is Born)

Pollinations didn't start as a company; it started as a **fix**. 

I wanted to make AI instant, shareable, and as easy as calling a function. I wanted to democratize not just access to models, but the *monetization* around them, ensuring the future of AI is open and community-driven.

> "We built Pollinations to make AI-driven creativity accessible to everyone and to facilitate an inclusive and collaborative future for AI and creativity."

My only approach is to use it and play with it because I don't see a scenario where I can put my head in the ground and let it pass by. So my only reaction to this is **embrace it**.

## The Teenage Hacker Spirit

Both I and my co-founders started out as teenagers making maps for games. We remember the dream of creating your own world and the incredibly high barrier to entry—reading 800-page books on assembly language just to get started.

Pollinations was born from that desire: to build something for the slightly nerdy, creative person who just wants to *build*, with zero bureaucracy. No sign-ups, no friction. **We built what we wished we had when we were 16.**
