# The Team Story

## Why We're The Ones To Build This

---

## The Pattern

The best infrastructure companies are built by people who **needed the infrastructure themselves**.

- **Stripe**: Patrick Collison couldn't accept payments for his projects
- **Twilio**: Jeff Lawson was frustrated by telecom APIs
- **Cloudflare**: Matthew Prince needed DDoS protection for his side project

**Pollinations**: Thomas couldn't give his teenage self access to AI.

## Thomas Haferlach — CEO

### The Journey

**Act I: The Obsession**
- Teenager tinkering with genetic algorithms and artificial life
- Before AI was cool, before it was funded, before anyone cared
- Father's scientific skepticism grounded exploration in rigor

**Act II: The Credentials**
- Edinburgh University, Computer Science & AI, top of class
- Published research: "Evolving a Neural Model of Insect Path Integration" (2007)
- Worked through the "AI Winter" when funding was scarce

**Act III: The Inside View**
- Amazon AI — saw how big tech builds AI infrastructure
- World Government Summit — researched AI trends for global leaders
- Pixelynx (Deadmau5/Richie Hawtin) — ML specialist for music AI

**Act IV: The Creative Detour**
- 9 years in São Paulo, Brazil
- Founded Voodoohop — influential art collective
- Built interactive installations merging AI, art, and music
- Learned that **creativity needs accessible tools**

**Act V: The Fix**
- Pollinations started as a side project in 2023
- "Generative URLs" — one line of code = AI generation
- Grew organically to millions of users
- **Built what teenage Thomas needed**

### Why Thomas

- **8+ years** in generative AI (before the hype)
- **€1.2M EU grant** winner for AI music technology
- **Deep technical credibility** + creative vision
- **Understands both sides**: enterprise AI and indie hackers

## The Extended Network

### Niels (Advisor)
- Published in **Nature** on AI safety
- Being recruited by **OpenAI and Anthropic**
- Brings academic credibility and cutting-edge research connections

### The Community
- **13K+ Discord members** actively contributing
- Young developers (18-22) proving themselves
- **Talent pipeline** we can hire from
- **Distributed R&D** at zero cost

---

## Why We Win

### 1. We're Not Tourists
We've been in AI for a decade. This isn't a pivot from crypto or a chase of the latest trend.

### 2. We Built It For Ourselves
Pollinations exists because we needed it. That's the best product intuition.

### 3. We Understand Both Worlds
- Enterprise AI (Amazon, consulting)
- Indie/creative AI (Voodoohop, music tech)

Most founders understand one. We understand both.

### 4. We Have The Community
You can't buy community. You can't hire community. You have to **earn** it over years.

We have.

## The Teenage Hacker Test

Every decision we make passes one test:

> "Would 16-year-old Thomas be able to use this?"

If the answer is no — if it requires a credit card, a signup flow, an enterprise contract — we don't ship it.

That's not just philosophy. That's **product discipline**.

And it's why millions of people use Pollinations today.
