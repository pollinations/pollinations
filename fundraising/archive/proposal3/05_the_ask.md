## Why Now

### The Window Is Open

1. **AI infrastructure is being decided** — in 2-3 years, the winners will be entrenched
2. **Open-source models are catching up** — the moat is shifting to distribution
3. **We have momentum** — 3M+ users, 300+ apps, growing 30% MoM
4. **Competition is asleep** — big players focused on enterprise, not indie devs

### The Window Will Close

- As AI matures, switching costs increase
- Training data advantages compound over time
- Community loyalty is earned, not bought
- **First mover in open AI infrastructure wins**

## What We're NOT Asking For

We're not asking you to bet on:
- ❌ A technology breakthrough (we use existing models)
- ❌ A single customer (we have thousands)
- ❌ A pivot (this is what we've always built)
- ❌ A market that doesn't exist (AI is here)

We're asking you to bet on:
- ✅ A team that's been in AI for a decade
- ✅ A community that's already built
- ✅ A business model that's proven (Unity Ads)
- ✅ Network effects that compound daily

## The Opportunity

**If AI becomes as essential as electricity, the open access layer becomes a utility.**

We're building that utility.

The question is: **Do you want to own a piece of it?**

## Next Steps

1. **Deep dive call** — Walk through metrics, product, roadmap
2. **Technical review** — Show the infrastructure, meet the team
3. **Community tour** — Join Discord, see the ecosystem live
4. **Term sheet** — Move fast, the window is open
