# 1. Personal Story

**Why I'm doing this — the gaming angle**

---

As a teenager, I made maps for games. I remember the dream of creating your own world — and the incredibly high barrier to entry. Reading 800-page books on assembly language just to get started.

I hacked my way into apps without a credit card. I tinkered with AI before it was cool — genetic algorithms, artificial life, neural models. Not chasing hype. Chasing understanding.

I studied AI at Edinburgh during the "AI winter" when no one cared. Worked at Amazon AI. Saw how big tech builds infrastructure — and who gets locked out.

**The pattern was always the same:**
- Access gated by credit cards
- APIs fragmented and complex
- Builders wasting 90% of their time on infrastructure

The 16-year-old in Indonesia with a brilliant game idea? Locked out.

**Then I saw what was happening in gaming.**

AI NPCs started breaking Roblox. Conversational AI became the biggest growth hack in gaming. Games with AI characters were dominating the charts.

But the kids building these games couldn't access the AI. Same old barriers — credit cards, enterprise contracts, complex SDKs.

**So I built what I wished I had when I was 16.**

One line of code. No signup. No credit card. Instant AI.

Now "Crazy Maid" hits >10K users per minute at launch. "AI Character RP" has 51 million player visits. First month revenue: $12K+.

**The next generation of game devs don't face the hurdles I did.**
