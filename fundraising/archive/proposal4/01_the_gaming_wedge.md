# The Gaming Wedge

## AI NPCs Are Breaking Roblox. We're Powering Them.

---

## The Insight

**Conversational AI is the biggest growth hack in gaming right now.**

Games with AI NPCs are dominating Roblox charts. Players want characters that talk back, adapt, and surprise them. Traditional scripted dialogue can't compete.

And we're the infrastructure behind the hits.

---

## The Proof

### "Crazy Maid" — An AI Game on Roblox

- **>10,000 users per minute** at launch
- Powered entirely by Pollinations

### "AI Character RP" — #1 AI Game on Roblox

- **51 million player visits**
- **2M+ monthly active users**
- **14M+ plays**
- First live ad-revenue pilot

### First Month Revenue from Games

**>$12,000** — and we're just getting started.

---

## Why Gaming First?

### 1. Massive Scale, Proven Demand

Roblox alone has **230 million monthly active users**. They're hungry for AI experiences.

### 2. Built-in Monetization

Gaming has solved monetization:
- In-app purchases
- Virtual currencies (Robux)
- Ad integrations

We plug directly into these systems.

### 3. Viral Distribution

Games spread organically. One hit = millions of users discovering Pollinations.

### 4. Young, AI-Native Audience

Roblox players are the **first generation of AI-native users**. They expect AI. They demand it.

## Why We Win in Gaming

### vs. Inworld, Convai (Enterprise AI NPCs)

| Factor | Inworld/Convai | Pollinations |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **Target** | Enterprise studios | Indie devs |
| **Pricing** | $$$ | Free to start |
| **Integration** | Complex SDK | One line of code |
| **Community** | None | 15K+ Discord |

**They're selling to EA. We're empowering the next EA.**

### vs. OpenAI, Hugging Face (Generic AI)

| Factor | OpenAI/HF | Pollinations |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **Focus** | Generic infrastructure | Gaming-optimized |
| **Onboarding** | Credit card required | No signup |
| **Templates** | None | Roblox Studio ready |
| **Support** | Docs only | Community + Discord |

**They're building picks and shovels. We're building the gold mine.**

## The Roblox Opportunity

### What If We Could Turn Roblox Players Into Creators?

Roblox has **230 million users**. Most are consumers. But the platform is built for creation.

**Our vision**: An "in-Roblox vibe coder" that lets anyone create AI-powered experiences without leaving the game.

- Player describes what they want in natural language
- Pollinations generates the AI logic
- Instant deployment within Roblox

**This is something Roblox themselves would want.**

## The Gaming Thesis

**Gaming is the wedge. Infrastructure is the destination.**

We're not a gaming company. We're an AI infrastructure company that's using gaming to:
1. **Prove product-market fit** (51M visits)
2. **Generate revenue** ($12K+ first month)
3. **Build distribution** (viral game mechanics)
4. **Establish credibility** (real users, real money)

Then we expand everywhere.
