## Why This Team Wins

### 1. We're Gamers

We understand the gaming audience because we are the gaming audience. Thomas and Elliot started as teenagers making maps for games.

### 2. We're Technical

Both Thomas and Elliot are hands-on engineers. We don't just manage — we build.

### 3. We Have Gaming Expertise

Kalam brings dedicated gaming strategy. This isn't a side project — it's our wedge.

### 4. We Move Fast

No enterprise bureaucracy. We ship weekly. Our Discord knows before our investors do.

## The Teenage Hacker Spirit

Every decision passes one test:

> "Would a 16-year-old on Roblox be able to use this?"

If it requires a credit card, a complex SDK, or enterprise sales — we don't ship it.

That's why we're winning in gaming.
That's why we'll win everywhere else.
