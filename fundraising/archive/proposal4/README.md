# Proposal 4: The Gaming Wedge

## Approach

Gaming-first narrative based on Roblox traction.

| Proposal | Core Framing |
|----------|--------------|
| **Proposal 1** | Personal journey + community flywheel |
| **Proposal 2** | "Teenage Hacker" + ad-funded compute |
| **Proposal 3** | AI infrastructure as utility (TCP/IP / OpenID for AI) |
| **Proposal 4** | **Gaming as the wedge → infrastructure as destination** |

## Key Differentiators

- **Concrete proof**: 51M player visits, $12K first month revenue
- **Clear wedge strategy**: Gaming → Platform → Infrastructure
- **Roblox-specific**: AI NPCs as killer app
- **Team with gaming expertise**: Kalam as CGO

## When to Use

Best for investors who:
- Want to see **concrete traction and revenue**
- Understand **gaming economics** (Roblox, in-app purchases)
- Like **wedge strategies** (start narrow, expand)
- Are skeptical of "boil the ocean" pitches
