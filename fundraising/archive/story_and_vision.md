## 1. Personal Story
**Why you are doing this (how you got here with pollinations, pain points you noticed, backstory)**

### Act I — Obsession
I grew up obsessed with AI before it was cool. As a teenager, I wasn't chasing hype—I was chasing understanding, tinkering with models and systems to see how they could extend human creativity.

### Act II — Mastery
This obsession led me to specialize in AI at university, where I graduated top of my class. I then entered the most advanced AI and big-tech environments (Amazon AI), working on the inside of the machine.

### Act III — Friction
While I loved the developer culture inside these great tech companies, I saw the same broken pattern everywhere for the outside world:
- Access was gated by **credit cards** and corporate signups.
- APIs were fragmented and complex.
- Builders were wasting 90% of their time on infrastructure instead of ideas.

### Act IV — Insight
I realized that while AI was becoming foundational infrastructure, the **on-ramp was broken**. The people most capable of building the future—indie devs, creative coders, "vibe" coders—were locked out by cost and complexity. It wasn't just a tooling problem; it was a **compute distribution problem**.

### Act V — Inevitability
Pollinations didn't start as a company; it started as a **fix**. I wanted to make AI instant, shareable, and as easy as calling a function. I wanted to democratize not just access to models, but the *monetization* around them, ensuring the future of AI is open and community-driven.

## 2. Vision
**What is now, where you see it going (the big vision)**

### What is Now (The Foundation)
Currently, we are building the infrastructure and economic layer for AI-native applications.
- **Pollinations.ai** is the first expression of this: a developer platform where anyone can build AI experiences without friction.
- **Pollen** is our universal credit system, currently connecting a growing network of 300+ apps and 3M+ monthly users.
- We are proving the model: Developers build, users engage, and we are beginning to unlock monetization through contextual ads (our "Unity Ads" moment).

### The Big Vision (Where We Are Going)
We imagine a future where AI is not locked behind corporate walls but is the fabric of a vibrant, open web.
- **The "Pollen Economy":** We are building a self-sustaining economy where `Pollen` is the universal currency for AI utilities across thousands of independent apps.
- **The "Unity for Gen-AI":** Just as Unity empowered game developers to monetize, we will be the engine that powers millions of AI micro-apps. We handle the identity, the wallet, the infrastructure, and the monetization.
- **Shared Success:** In this ecosystem, every new app strengthens the network. Developers earn a living (via revenue share like our "Nectar" program), advertisers reach engaged audiences, and users get a seamless, magical experience across the web.

**Ultimate Goal:** To democratize the *creation* and *wealth* of the AI revolution, ensuring it remains an open, creative, and human-centric space.
