## 📈 Estimated Credit Value for Pollinations

### Based on Current Load (~2.5M requests/day):

**Image Generation (Primary Use)**:
- $15K credits ÷ $0.0027 (FLUX schnell) = **5.5M images**
- At 577 RPM average = **~6.6 days of full image load**
- At current mix (~23% image) = **~29 days of total load**

**Text Generation (Secondary Use)**:
- $15K credits at avg $0.04/1M tokens = **375M tokens**
- At 26K tokens/sec average = **~4 hours of full text load**
- Would cover peak bursts and experimentation

**Combined Strategy**:
- Use credits primarily for image generation (highest cost)
- Supplement with text model testing (DeepSeek, Qwen)
- Experiment with video/audio for product expansion
