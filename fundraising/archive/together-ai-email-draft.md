# Email Draft: Together AI Startup Credits Response

---

**Subject**: Re: Together AI Platform Services - Pollinations Usage Data

---

Hi Raj,

Following up on our call, here's a snapshot of our current platform usage at Pollinations.AI.

## Current Scale

We're processing **~2.5M requests daily** with steady week-over-week growth:

- **Image Generation**: ~577 RPM average (peak: 1,474 RPM) - our primary GPU workload
- **Text Models**: ~337 RPM average, processing ~26K tokens/sec (peak: 34K tokens/sec)
- **Total Load**: ~1,900 RPM sustained

## Growth Metrics (from KPI dashboard)

- **New Registrations**: 3,175 last week (+19% WoW)
- **Weekly Active Users**: 4,377 (+19% WoW)
- **Weekly Revenue**: $690 (growing)
- **Total Tokens**: 5.6B last week
- **Community**: 13K+ Discord members, 1,000+ published apps

## Why Together AI is a Strong Fit

After reviewing your platform, I'm particularly interested in:

1. **Cost Optimization** - Your FLUX.1 [schnell] at $0.0027/MP is significantly more cost-effective than our current mix, perfect for our high-volume image generation workload

2. **Model Diversity** - DeepSeek-V3.1 and Qwen3 models offer excellent price/performance for our text workload, with the large context windows (128K-262K) we need

3. **Expansion Opportunities** - Your video generation models (MiniMax) and TTS capabilities (Arcana v2) align with our roadmap to expand beyond images

## Immediate Use Cases

- **Primary**: Migrate high-volume image generation to FLUX schnell/dev models
- **Secondary**: Test DeepSeek/Qwen for cost-effective text generation
- **Exploratory**: Video generation for our Roblox/gaming creator community

The Build tier credits ($15K) would cover ~29 days of our current load on FLUX schnell, giving us significant runway to optimize costs during this growth phase.

Happy to discuss technical integration details and how we can leverage your forward-deployed engineering support.

Best regards,

Hi Raj,

Following up on our call with some key metrics:

**Current Scale:**
- 2.5M requests/day (growing week-over-week)
- 577 RPM image generation (peak: 1,474 RPM)
- 26K tokens/sec text processing (peak: 34K)
- 3,175 new signups last week (+19% WoW)

**Why Together AI:**
After reviewing your platform, your FLUX.1 [schnell] ($0.0027/MP) and DeepSeek/Qwen text models are perfect for our high-volume, cost-sensitive workload. The Build tier credits would cover ~29 days of our current image generation load.

**Immediate Interest:**
- Migrate image generation to FLUX models (primary cost driver)
- Test DeepSeek-V3.1/Qwen3 for text diversity
- Explore video generation for our Roblox creator community (1K+ apps)

Looking forward to discussing integration and leveraging your engineering support.

Best,  
Thomas

## Notes for Thomas:

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
1. Scale (2.5M/day) shows you're a serious user
2. Growth metrics (19% WoW) show momentum
3. Specific model interest (FLUX schnell, DeepSeek) shows you've done homework
4. Community reach (13K Discord, 1K apps) shows partnership value
5. Cost optimization focus aligns with startup credits purpose

**What to Avoid:**
- Don't overwhelm with technical jargon (RPM, tokens/sec are enough)
- Don't include Elliot's detailed breakdown (save for follow-up if needed)
- Don't sound desperate - position as mutual opportunity

**Attachments to Consider:**
- Screenshot 1 (Acquisition & Usage charts) - shows growth trajectory
- Screenshot 3 (Weekly metrics) - shows current scale

**Follow-up Strategy:**
- If they ask for more detail, share the full analysis document
- If they want technical specs, share Elliot's breakdown
- If they want to discuss integration, mention OpenAI-compatible APIs
