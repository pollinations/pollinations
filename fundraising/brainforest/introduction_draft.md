# Introduction Draft - AI, Psychedelics, and the Nature of Consciousness

From my earliest memories, I've been captivated by the nature of intelligence, consciousness, and technology's potential to create something entirely new. As a teenager, I found myself immersed in the world of artificial life and genetic algorithms, fascinated by the idea of simulating life-like processes with code. Creating systems that could learn and adapt was a thrilling challenge.

My formal entry into AI studies happened in the early 2000s - a period often referred to as the "AI winter." Funding was scarce, and progress seemed to have slowed. Despite this, I was drawn to the field, intrigued by the potential of machine learning and the questions it raised about the nature of intelligence.

Today, the AI landscape has transformed dramatically. We're witnessing capabilities that even the most optimistic among us couldn't have predicted. As Dennis McKenna aptly put it, "The World as We Know It Has Ended" - we're entering a new era of change and possibility.

I'm fundamentally an optimist about technology's potential. This rapid acceleration of AI fills me with a sense of wonder, but also a deep sense of responsibility. I believe that if we guide it wisely, technology has the potential to enhance human consciousness and help create a more equitable world. However, I don't share the vision of a future dominated by superpowers competing for AI dominance and military advantage. Instead, I'm drawn to a path where AI empowers individuals, sparks creativity, and helps us connect with the intelligence that already exists all around us.

Interestingly, my journey into AI has been paralleled by explorations in other realms of consciousness. Around the same time I started studying AI, I also began experimenting with psychedelics, including extracting DMT for the first time using a recipe I found online. These parallel paths have led me to some unexpected insights about the nature of mind and awareness.

My explorations in both AI and psychedelics have revealed a startling truth: intelligence and consciousness are far more diverse than we typically assume. It's not just about human or animal cognition. There's a vast spectrum of awareness waiting to be recognized, from the intricate communication networks of fungi beneath our feet to the alien cognition of artificial neural networks.
