## Thomas's Introduction (by Dennis McKenna)

Thomas Haferlach merges machine learning wizardry with music and multimedia art, exploring the realms of psychedelia from artistic and scientific perspectives. He founded Voodoo Hop, an influential art collective celebrated by São Paulo's art scene. Utilizing generative AI, Thomas crafts new musical expressions that blend high tech in unexpected and glitchy ways.

Born in Germany and after studying computer science and artificial intelligence at Edinburgh University, he spent nine years in São Paulo creating an art collective while always keeping 1ft in the technology sector. He conceived and implemented a variety of interactive installations combining his passion for art, research and technology.

After settling back in Germany, he completed a project which involved researching the future trends of artificial intelligence for the World government summit. Since then, he has spent a few years researching and working with data driven generative audio modeling. He built the first open source platform, pollinations AI, which has the aim of making generative machine learning more accessible.

## Thomas on His Background & Skeptical Upbringing

"It's kind of funny because I come from a rather, let's say scientific background. My dad was very, let's say a very big skeptic when it comes to anything, let's say mystic or occult or religious. He was kind of, he's kind of known for getting into arguments with our neighbors when they bring up religion or maybe let's say, being quite critical of any kind of theory that is not extremely well kind of, let's say scientific fundamentals.

Extremely skeptical about religion, about altered states, about mysticism and so on. And I basically, I grew up with this kind of mindset.

I studied, I went to school. I was very interested in physics from an early age. And then when I went to study it became quite clear to me that I wanted to study artificial intelligence. So this was already from quite a young age I had this kind of desire to learn about let's say machine intelligence.

And I think it was definitely connected to like quite a strong fascination about like the kind of question about what is consciousness? What is our purpose?"

## On AI's Rapid Development

"The thing is, I mean, like, it feels to me like we've been very arrogant, right? As humans we believed in rapid expansion. We believed we could industrialize everything... We had this kind of egoism, right, where we believe we understand this planet so well that we can radically modify it."

"These systems have developed incredibly fast suddenly. And we can see when we follow the curves, right, in terms of, like, how the intelligence is growing, we can follow the curves and see that we are on an exponential curve."

## On Open Source & Democratizing AI

"I've been kind of working at different AI companies, and also I started my own company, which is more focused on open source. So, like, one thing that does give me hope is the fact that there's a very large, let's say, open source movement, especially in the AI field, wherever results are reproducible.

You can even try these things yourself at home. And like, this technology is accessible, you know, and I am seeing it also being used for good in terms of, like, education. In terms of education because it is a very good tutor. You know, I've seen that with friends around me who have started to learn things like coding because they have AI assistance now. So it does have a, let's say democratizing possibility to democratize access to information."

## On Embracing AI Rather Than Fearing It

"My only, of course my approach is I'm using it and playing with it because I don't see a way, a scenario where I can kind of put my head in the ground and let it pass by. So my only reaction to this is embrace it."

"I try to break down a little bit also the kind of fear of AI by making art with it, by making funny stories with it... because at the same time as I see all the danger, I find it extremely fascinating also as a tool to potentially better ourselves."

## On Psychedelics & Humility

"A deep DMT experience or deep mushroom experience in nature opens you up to the kind of complexity of the ecosystem... Psychedelics kind of open you up to this complexity and it can be almost frightening, right? And you can also have it like. But I think this man trip that you get where you put into your place where it's like, okay, you're very stupid organism living on earth, right? You get that. You can get that from psychedelics."

"I think that's something that psychedelics and DMT kind of showed me in a way. They made me humble."
