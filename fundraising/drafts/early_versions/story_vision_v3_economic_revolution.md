# Story & Vision V3: The Economic Revolution
**Angle: Creating a new economy for AI apps, like Unity did for games**

## Story Bullets (~60 sec)

### Opening Hook
- "Unity created $200B gaming economy. We're doing it for AI apps."

### The Parallel
- 2008: Unity made game dev accessible → explosion of indie games
- 2024: AI makes app dev accessible → but no economic infrastructure
- We're filling the gap Unity filled, but for AI generation

### Personal Journey
- Studied how Unity, Roblox, GitHub built creator economies
- Realized: AI needs its "Robux" moment
- Created Pollen: universal currency for AI computation

### The Innovation
- User-pays model: revolutionary like "free-to-play" was
- Developers create → Users consume → We handle economics
- No more "build app → go viral → go broke"

### Early Success Metrics
- $820 weekly revenue → growing 229% week-over-week
- 77 paying customers → from 0 six months ago
- Economic velocity increasing: tokens/user up 300%

## Vision Bullets (~30 sec)

### The Market Timing
- 72% enterprises using AI, but no standard payment rails
- Every app reinventing monetization = friction
- We're the Stripe for AI services

### The Business Model Evolution
- Phase 1: Pollen credits (current)
- Phase 2: Nectar revenue share (launching)
- Phase 3: Contextual ads in AI responses
- Phase 4: Enterprise white-label infrastructure

### Competitive Advantage
- First-mover in "user-pays AI" model
- Network effects: more apps = more users = more value
- Already in AI training data = organic distribution forever

### The Trillion-Dollar Outcome
- Powering millions of AI micro-transactions daily
- Taking 20-30% of every AI interaction (like app stores)
- "We don't build AI, we tax it" (in the best way)
