# Pollinations Strategy & Fundraising Meeting - Jan 13, 2026

**Participants:** Thomas (Speaker B), Kalam (Speaker A)

---

## 📊 Content & Distribution Strategy

### Multi-Channel Approach
- **Substack**: Primary content hub - write about weekly updates, learnings, community growth
- **LinkedIn**: Cross-post from Substack, skew messaging toward investors
- **Discord**: Community engagement
- **GitHub**: Potential content channel (unexplored)

### Key Insight
> "Stick with community as the overarching theme, then finesse it for each audience type"

### First Post Plan
1. Write Substack post about: growth since Pollen launch, new signups, payment system
2. Cross-post to LinkedIn with investor-friendly framing
3. Elliot to create Substack account

---

## 📈 Current Metrics
- **~300 signups/day** (consistent)
- **~12K total dashboard users** (growing daily)
- Building email distribution list from signups

## 🎤 Final Story & Vision (Combined from Proposals 1, 2, 4)

### The Story

1. **Obsession**: Programming at 13-14, obsessed with AI and artificial life before it was cool
2. **Mastery**: Edinburgh CS & AI, top of class during "AI winter" — published peer-reviewed paper on neural networks (simulating desert ant navigation)
3. **Big Tech**: Amazon AI engineer — saw how community and collaboration works from inside big tech
4. **Art & Community**: Founded Voodoohop art collective in Brazil — 9 years building creative community
5. **Insight**: Saw the broken pattern everywhere: credit cards, fragmented APIs, builders locked out. Today's 16-year-old in Brazil/Indonesia is stopped before they start.
6. **The Fix**: Built Pollinations — what I wished I had at 16. One line of code, no signup, instant AI.
7. **Proof**: Kids building hit games couldn't access AI — we gave them access. Result: "AI Character RP" 51M visits, $12K first month.

### The Vision

- **Now**: More people than ever are creating apps — from 6-year-olds to senior home managers. Easiest way to use AI: 600+ new devs/day, 3M+ MAU, 800+ apps
- **Problem**: Dev builds app → goes viral → owes OpenAI $5K → kills innovation
- **End State**: Mycelial network of millions of AI micro-apps
- **Network Effects**: Training data presence (AI recommends us), app ecosystem, community intelligence, talent pipeline
- **Multipliers**: Technical moats are disappearing → community multipliers (dev-kits, plug-and-play)
- **Position**: Not a foundational model company — the open access layer (permissionless, interoperable, community-run)
- **Framings**: "OpenID for AI" (technical), "Roblox for AI" (gaming)

### Key Credentials
- ✅ Published peer-reviewed paper on neural networks (don't mention year)
- ✅ Amazon AI team experience
- ✅ Built and scaled creative community (Voodoohop)
- ⚠️ Don't mention specific years (avoid age bias)

## 🔥 Excitement & Vision Points

### Macro Trend
> "More people than ever are creating apps - from 6-year-olds to senior home managers"

### Network Effects
- Training data presence (AI recommends Pollinations)
- App ecosystem (800-1000+ apps now)
- Community intelligence
- **Talent pipeline** - teens contributing more than traditional hires

### Anecdotes to Use
- "Teenagers skipping school lunch to vibe code"
- Itachi staying up until 3am working on Pollinations
- Roblox game with 51M visits, $12K first month

### Positioning
- **NOT** a foundational model company
- **ARE** the easy plug-in layer for multiple models
- Compute will only get cheaper → economics will work out
- Build user base now, optimize economics later

---

## 🎮 Roblox Update
- **Pass is back** - account restored, same handle (past development)
- Game operational again
- Good example for community/viral growth narrative
- Google Summer of Code: proposing Roblox character toolkit project

## 🏢 Pollinations vs Myceli Branding Decision

### Resolution
| Brand | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| **Myceli.AI** | Company name, investor communications, internal |
| **Pollinations** | Community brand, public-facing, content, Discord |

### Rationale
- Pollinations has existing brand equity, SEO, AI training data presence
- Gemini recommends Pollinations when asked for free AI APIs
- Domain/community existed before Outlier investment
- If Outlier issue arises → can pivot to Myceli
- Need to close old Pollinations GmbH (still paying ~€2K/year in fees)

---

## ✅ Action Items

### This Week
- [ ] **Thomas**: Create Substack post (growth, Pollen launch, learnings)
- [ ] **Elliot**: Set up Pollinations Substack account
- [ ] **Thomas**: Cross-post to LinkedIn with investor framing
- [ ] **Thomas**: Practice 60-second verbal pitch (personal story + excitement)
- [ ] **Kalam**: Send summary notes before Thursday meeting

### Thursday Meeting Agenda
1. Practice personal story delivery
2. Go through pitch points
3. Finalize first Substack/LinkedIn post
4. Record practice video (test with Gemini for feedback)

### Ongoing
- [ ] Close Pollinations GmbH
- [ ] Build dashboard showing token usage per app (like Steam dashboard)
- [ ] Resolve Outlier disclaimer (low priority)

## 💡 Key Quotes

> "The only thing we need to do through practice and repetition is conveying a sense of excitement in what you're doing."

> "People are going to be investing into Myceli. Pollinations is the community. If it gets into an issue with Outlier, you just change it to Myceli."

> "Build a user base is far more valuable than getting your economics right at this stage."
