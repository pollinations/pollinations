# Strategy Meeting - Jan 15, 2026

## Focus Areas
1. **Excitement** — SCQA Framework (a16z)

3. **Substack/Social** — Presence planning
4. **Timeline** — One-pager, fundraising schedule

## 1. SCQA Framework (a16z)

Created structured pitch framework based on a16z guidance.

### Situation
- AI is everywhere, technical moats disappearing
- Everyone can build apps now — "vibe coders" explosion

### Complication
- Messy experience: fragmented APIs, credit card barriers
- Backend complexity: secrets, rate limits, security
- Financial risk: app goes viral → $5K bill → kills innovation
- No community support system

### Question
- How do you experiment, start, build, learn — and grow with a community?

### Answer
- **One API** — all popular models, one endpoint
- **Free to start** — daily credits, no credit card
- **Tiers that scale** — API levels up with you
- **Community** — 13K+ Discord, starter kits, gamified points
- **Brand** — permissionless, open source, "Roblox for AI"

**Key phrase**: "Our API levels up with you"

📄 Full framework saved to: `pitches/SCQA-framework.md`

## 2. Personal Story — Practice Session (Attempt 3)

### Key Feedback
- **Be snappy** — bang, bang, bang, impress them fast
- **Don't drop university names** — just say "top university for AI"
- **Published + peer-reviewed** = the important words (basically a PhD)
- **Merge Big Tech + Community** — hacking spirit connects both
- **"Talent locked out"** — better than focusing on credit cards (investors don't care about democratization framing)
- **End with proof** — the Roblox hit

### Refined Structure (~60 sec total)

**Part 1: The Beginnings** (~15 sec) — *Bang, bang, bang*
- Obsessed with AI as teenager — coding games, gravity simulations at 13
- Top university for AI — graduated top of class
- Published peer-reviewed paper on neural networks
- *(Only if asked: simulating how ants navigate, also did AI car racing)*

**Part 2: Big Tech + Community** (~15 sec)
- Hired straight out of university by Amazon as AI engineer
- Also built grassroots creative community
- **Key line**: "I've seen how community and collaboration works — both in corporate AI and grassroots organizations"

**Part 3: The Problem + The Fix** (~20 sec)
- Saw the same issues everywhere — walled gardens, APIs, talent locked out
- Any developer starting now faces the same barriers I did
- Built Pollinations — what I wished I had at 16
- One line of code, no signup, instant AI

**Part 4: Proof** (~10 sec)
- Thousands of devs worldwide — 600+ signing up daily
- 20 apps published per day
- **Hit game**: teenager built Roblox game → 51M visits, $12K first month

### Vision (First Pass)
- More people than ever creating apps — 600+ devs/day, 20+ apps/day
- 1,000+ apps in ecosystem, apps going viral
- **Position**: Not a foundational model company — open access layer
- **"We meet you where you are"** (more relatable than "permissionless, interoperable")
- **End state**: Mycelial network of millions of AI micro-apps
- **Moat**: Community multipliers (dev-kits, starter kits)

### Reminders
- ⚠️ Don't mention specific years (age bias)
- ⚠️ Don't dwell on details — just hit the beats
- ⚠️ By attempt 10, it should be automatic
- ✅ Peer-reviewed paper establishes credibility early
- ✅ "Talent locked out" resonates better than "credit card barrier"

## 3. Substack Plan

### First Article
- **Title**: "Why I Built What I Wished I Had at 16"
- **Audience**: The Pollinations community (people staying up till 3am building)
- **Goal**: Make them feel seen + share where you want to go
- **Deadline**: Next week (latest)
- **Cross-post to**: LinkedIn (same title works well)

### Future Topics
- The vibe coder revolution
- Case study: 16-year-old builds 51M visit game
- Technical moats are disappearing
- The $5K bill that kills innovation
