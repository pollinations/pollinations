## 1. SCQA Framework (a16z)

Created structured pitch framework based on a16z guidance.

### Situation
- AI is everywhere, technical moats disappearing
- Everyone can build apps now — "vibe coders" explosion

### Complication
- Messy experience: fragmented APIs, credit card barriers
- Backend complexity: secrets, rate limits, security
- Financial risk: app goes viral → $5K bill → kills innovation
- No community support system

### Question
- How do you experiment, start, build, learn — and grow with a community?

### Answer
- **One API** — all popular models, one endpoint
- **Free to start** — daily credits, no credit card
- **Tiers that scale** — API levels up with you
- **Community** — 13K+ Discord, starter kits, gamified points
- **Brand** — permissionless, open source, "Roblox for AI"

**Key phrase**: "Our API levels up with you"

📄 Full framework saved to: `pitches/SCQA-framework.md`

## 2. Personal Story — Practice Session

### Feedback from Practice
- **Too many details** — pick 1-2 vivid examples
- **Merge Big Tech + Community** into one insight
- **Don't dwell** — just hit the beats
- **End with proof** — the Roblox hit

### Refined Structure (3 Parts, ~60 sec)

**Part 1: The Beginnings** (~20 sec)
- Obsessed with AI as teenager — coding games, simulations at 14
- Edinburgh CS & AI — graduated top of class
- Published peer-reviewed paper on neural networks (desert ant navigation)

**Part 2: Big Tech + Community** (~15 sec)
- Amazon AI + Voodoohop art collective (almost a decade)
- **Key line**: "I've seen both corporate AI and grassroots creative communities from the inside"

**Part 3: The Insight + The Fix** (~25 sec)
- Same walled gardens everywhere — credit cards, APIs, talent locked out
- Built Pollinations — what I wished I had at 16
- **Proof**: 600+ devs/day, 20 apps/day, Roblox hit 51M visits

### Key Reminders
- ⚠️ Don't mention specific years (age bias)
- ⚠️ Neural networks + biological systems + robotics = memorable combo
- ✅ Peer-reviewed paper establishes credibility early
