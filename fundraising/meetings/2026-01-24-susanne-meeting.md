## 🔥 HIGH PRIORITY TOPICS (from WhatsApp)

### 1. Pollinations.ai ↔ Myceli.ai Entity Clarification
**Status**: Needs discussion  
**Context**:
- Antler invested in **Myceli GmbH**
- **Myceli** = the legal entity (company)
- **Pollinations** = the brand
- Old Pollinations GmbH still exists, trying to close it
- Susanne says: "It's just a GmbH name - not a priority for the round, just keep comms consistent"

**Action**: Align on messaging - always say "Myceli GmbH, operating as Pollinations"?

### 2. Outlier Ventures Situation ⚠️
**Status**: Potential red flag for due diligence  
**Context**:
- Pollinations is still in [Outlier Ventures portfolio](https://outlierventures.io/portfolio/pollinations/)
- Haven't spoken to them in years
- They haven't responded to recent emails
- Was crypto/NFT focused back then

**Action**: Discuss how to handle this - could be a due diligence issue

### 3. Hiring Roadmap & Use of Funds
**Susanne's Framework** (important!):
> "Think top-down: The question is NOT what you do with the money, but what target state should be achieved... what milestones does Pollinations want to reach. THEN the second question is - who/what do you need for that."

**Two big areas**:
1. Hiring
2. AI infrastructure costs

**Action**: Define milestones FIRST, then derive hiring needs

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS FROM SUSANNE

1. **Entity naming**: "Myceli is the company, Pollinations is the brand" - just keep comms consistent
2. **Top-down thinking**: Milestones first, then resources needed
3. **Outlier situation**: "All solvable" - will discuss tomorrow
4. **MFN clauses**: Need to check existing CLA for these
