# Pollinations Cloud Credits and Community Strategy Update
**Date**: Thu, 29 Jan 2026

---

## 🚨 Critical Infrastructure Issue

- **Internal API key accidentally committed to GitHub repository**
  - Bypassed billing system for extended period
  - Lost approximately **60k in cloud credits** (AWS/Google)
  - Normal spend would have been ~40k, so actual loss closer to **20k**

### Issue Resolution
- Issue discovered and fixed
- Tightening deployment processes to prevent recurrence
- Need better monitoring of actual cloud provider spending

---

## Impact on Business Operations

- **95% of users on free tier**, only 5% paying
- Credits were being used to fuel user growth during fundraising phase
- Forces earlier monetization decisions:
  1. Gate expensive models (video models) to paid tiers only
  2. Reduce daily free "pollen" grants from 10 to 5
  3. Maintain free tier for experimentation with cheaper models
- Timing challenging during fundraising but could force revenue focus

---

## Community Communication Strategy

- Announcing changes **one day before implementation**
- Removing "actively fundraising" language from announcement
  - Replace with "excited about next phase"
  - Avoid user anxiety about service stability
- Clarify "tier grants" terminology to "daily pollen grants"
- Emphasize continued free experimentation capability

## Fundraising Strategy Refinement

- Current ask of **€2.5M feels too small** for opportunity scale
- Need to work backwards from growth targets:
  - **Target**: 30k-200k active developers
  - Model revenue potential from developer-to-end-user conversion
  - Calculate team and infrastructure costs accordingly
- Shift to **bolder positioning** while maintaining honesty in follow-up discussions
- Reference [Flora.ai](http://flora.ai/)'s €42M raise as market benchmark (be bolder)
