# Elevator Pitch

## One-Liner
**"The open AI infrastructure that rewards builders."**

---

## 30-Second Pitch

AI allows **everyone to be a coder**. Interacting with ChatGPT is **coding in natural language**. A prompt is the **source code** for AI applications.

We provide the **AI platform** for our vibrant community to easily build **gen AI apps** - with a **gamified tier system** that rewards contributors with Pollen credits.

The more you build and contribute, the more you earn. **User-pays model** means infinite scalability.

## The Problem

### For Indie/Vibe Coders:
- ⚙️ **Complex AI Access & High Costs** - stifles creation
- 🔑 **API Key Hell** - managing multiple providers, billing, security
- 📈 **No Path to Sustainability** - can't scale without burning money

---

## The Solution

**Pollinations solves the disconnect between wanting to build and being able to afford it.**

- **Zero-friction start**: One line of code = AI generation (no signup required)
- **Pollen Credits**: Gamified tier system rewards contributions
- **User-Pays Model**: Like Puter.js - users cover their own usage, devs pay nothing
- **GitHub-based Tiers**: Deep metrics from git create positive reward cycles

## Tagline Options

- **"Build AI apps. Earn Pollen. Scale infinitely."**
- **"The Roblox for AI"** – a global, open platform where developers and non-coders alike can easily create, deploy and monetise AI applications
- **"Democratise generative AI"** – make state-of-the-art creation tools free and open so anyone can build, share and monetise AI-powered experiences
