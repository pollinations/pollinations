## What We Provide

Pollinations is a "no-keys, no-friction" creation layer on top of cutting-edge AI models. We give makers three things:

1. **Instant API Endpoints** – copy-paste a URL to generate text, images, audio. No log-in required for the first call.

2. **AI-Integrated SDKs & Starter Kits** – use your preferred AI assistant to launch projects across multiple platforms with community-supported templates.

3. **Edge AI at Scale** – every request transparently taps our global GPU fleet; the developer never touches infrastructure.
