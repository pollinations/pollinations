# Business Model & Monetization

## The Pollen Economy

Pollinations uses a **Pollen credit system** with a **gamified tier system** that rewards builders.

## How It Works

### 1. User-Pays Model (Inspired by Puter.js)
Instead of developers paying for infrastructure, **users cover their own AI usage**:
- Developers pay nothing for infrastructure
- Users purchase Pollen credits for what they use
- Infinite scalability at zero cost to developers
- No anti-abuse systems needed - bad actors pay for their own abuse

### 2. Gamified Tier System
Users earn higher tiers based on **GitHub contributions and activity**:
- Deep metrics from git create a **positive reward cycle**
- More contributions = more credits = higher tier = better access
- Points system rewards building and contributing
- Creates virtuous cycle of community growth

### 3. Bring Your Own Pollen
- Users can purchase Pollen packs
- Currently supporting many devs generously
- Revenue growing steadily
