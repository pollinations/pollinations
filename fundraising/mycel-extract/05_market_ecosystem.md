# Market & Ecosystem

## The AI Infrastructure Market

The market for AI infrastructure and developer tools is exploding as every app becomes AI-native.

---

## Why This Market?

- **Category tail-winds**: Gen-AI usage still compounding exponentially
- **Lowest friction on the market**: zero-key APIs + one-command deploy is unmatched
- **Network-effect moat**: every new app ↔ more community ↔ better tools ↔ more apps
- **User-pays model**: Infinite scalability without infrastructure costs

---

## Our Position

**We're the open AI infrastructure that rewards builders.**

Like Puter.js democratized cloud computing with user-pays, we're doing the same for AI generation.
