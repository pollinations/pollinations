## Current Business Model (Jan 2026)

### Pollen Credits + Gamified Tiers

1. **User-Pays Model** (like Puter.js)
   - Users cover their own AI usage
   - Developers pay nothing for infrastructure
   - Infinite scalability at zero cost

2. **Gamified Tier System**
   - Deep metrics from GitHub create positive reward cycles
   - More contributions = more credits = higher tier = better access
   - Points system rewards building and contributing

3. **Bring Your Own Pollen**
   - Users can purchase Pollen packs
   - Currently supporting many devs generously
   - Revenue growing steadily (~$820/week)
