**GitLab, MongoDB, Elastic, HashiCorp, and Grafana Labs stand out as successful community-driven open-source companies, with GitLab reaching a $15B+ valuation and MongoDB exceeding $20B as of recent market data.** These firms began as open-source projects, grew through active community contributions, and monetized via enterprise features, cloud services, or dual-licensing while maintaining strong developer engagement.[1][3][4][5]

### Key Examples with Metrics
Limited public data provides exact valuations and revenue tied directly to community models, but here's the most authoritative info from sources:

| Company       | Community Role                                                                 | Valuation (as of 2023 data) | Revenue/Other Metrics                  | Sources |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------|
| **GitLab**   | Evolved from open-source repo to DevOps platform via community contributions in CI/CD tools. | Part of OSS top performers; market cap ~$15B implied in indexes. | Strong growth from community-driven innovation. | [1][4][5] |
| **MongoDB**  | Open-source NoSQL database with massive community adoption fueling enterprise shift. | Top 3 open-source firm; valuation >$20B in OSS basket. | High commercial impact via community forks and usage. | [1][4][5] |
| **Elastic**  | Started as open-source search; community engagement in analytics drove leadership position. | OSS basket leader; ~$10B+ valuation context. | Balances community transparency with commercial growth. | [1][4][5] |
| **HashiCorp**| Core tools like Terraform fully open-source; 250M+ annual downloads from community. | Top 4 firm; strong in OSS indexes with ~$5B+ valuation. | Community downloads indicate massive adoption. | [3][4][5] |
| **Grafana Labs** | Thrives on forums, docs, and contributor acknowledgments turning users into advocates. | High GitHub adoption (top 5 contributors); YC-backed growth. | Community feedback loops drive product and business expansion. | [1][5][6] |

**MariaDB** saw 1B+ downloads and 200K contributions from Linux distro communities, enabling commercial database success.[3] **H2O.ai** serves 18K+ organizations via open-source ML tools like H2O, with community plugins like Sparkling Water amplifying reach.[3]

These companies succeed by fostering contributor ecosystems—e.g., GitLab and Grafana via feedback integration, HashiCorp via downloads—leading to sustainable revenue without full proprietary lock-in. Data gaps exist for 2024-2026 revenues, as sources predate recent filings; valuations from Pitchbook/indices as of March 2023.[5] YC funds 152+ open-source startups, signaling ongoing community-driven potential.[6]
