# SCQA Framework - Pollinations Pitch

*Situation, Complication, Question, Answer — from a16z framework*

---

## SITUATION
**AI is everywhere. Technical moats are disappearing. Everyone can build apps now.**

- AI lets anyone code — natural language is the new programming
- Influx of young/indie devs, teens, "vibe coders" entering the market
- Model commoditization — open-source catching up to proprietary
- Every app will have AI features

---

## COMPLICATION
**Messy experience. Financial risk. Backend complexity. No community.**

- **API fragmentation** — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, each with different APIs, keys, billing
- **Credit card barrier** — 16-year-old in Brazil/Indonesia can't even start
- **Backend complexity** — secrets management, rate limits, security
- **Financial risk** — app goes viral → massive unexpected bill
- **No support system** — you're on your own with docs and YouTube
- **No path to level up** — no reputation, no recognition for contributions

---

## QUESTION
**How do you experiment, start, build, learn — and grow with a community?**

- How does a teen with no credit card build an AI app?
- How do you scale when success means a $5K bill?
- How do you get support when you're stuck?
- How do you build reputation and level up as a dev?

---

## ANSWER
**One API. Free to start. Community that levels up with you.**

### 🌸 The Brand: Pollinations
