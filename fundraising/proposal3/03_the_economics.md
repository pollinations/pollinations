# The Economics

## How Free Becomes Profitable

## The Question Every Investor Asks

> "If it's free, how do you make money?"

The answer: **We don't charge for compute. We monetize attention.**

## The Ad-Supported Compute Model

Every AI generation is a **moment of attention**.

- User requests an image → waits 2-5 seconds → receives result
- User requests text → streams for 3-10 seconds → reads output

That attention has value. We capture it.

```
Traditional Model:
User → Pays $$ → Gets AI Output

Pollinations Model:
User → Sees Contextual Ad → Gets AI Output → Developer Gets Revenue Share
```

## Why This Works (The Unity Precedent)

**Unity Ads** proved this model in gaming:
- Developers get free tools
- Users watch ads for in-game rewards
- Unity takes a cut
- **$1.3B revenue in 2023**

We're applying the same model to AI:
- Developers get free compute
- Users see contextual ads in generations
- Developers get 50% revenue share
- **Everyone wins**

## The Unit Economics

### Per 1,000 Generations (Projected 2027)

| Line Item | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Ad Revenue (Net) | ~€1.40 |
| AI Compute Cost | ~€0.20 |
| Developer Share (50%) | ~€0.60 |
| **Pollinations Net** | **~€0.60** |

**60% gross margin** at scale.

## Revenue Projections

| Timeline | Ad-Served Generations | CPM | Gross Revenue | Pollinations Share |
|----------|----------------------|-----|---------------|-------------------|
| 12 months | 250M/month | $1.00 | $250K/month | $125K/month |
| 24 months | 1.6B/month | $1.00 | $1.6M/month | $800K/month |
| 36 months | 5B/month | $1.50 | $7.5M/month | $3.75M/month |

**Path to $45M ARR by Year 3.**

## The Premium Layer

Ads aren't the only revenue stream.

### Pollen Credits (Pay-As-You-Go)
- $1 = 1 Pollen = ~5,000 image generations
- For users who want ad-free experience
- For developers who want guaranteed SLAs

### Premium Tiers
- Faster generation
- Priority queue
- Private/custom models
- Enterprise features

### Current Metrics (Jan 2026)
- 77 weekly paying customers
- $820/week revenue
- **Growing from zero** (payment system launched recently)

## The Flywheel Economics

```
More Apps → More Users → More Ad Inventory → More Revenue
     ↑                                              ↓
     ←←←←←← Developer Revenue Share ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←
```

Developers earn money → They build more apps → More users → More revenue → ...

**Self-sustaining ecosystem.**

## Why We Win on Cost

### Our Advantages:
1. **Multi-provider arbitrage**: We route to cheapest provider per request
2. **Caching**: Similar prompts hit cache, zero compute cost
3. **Open-source models**: Llama, Mistral cost fraction of GPT-4
4. **Community infrastructure**: Contributors reduce our R&D costs

### Competitor Disadvantages:
1. **Single provider lock-in**: Can't optimize across providers
2. **Enterprise overhead**: Sales teams, support, compliance
3. **Margin requirements**: VCs expect 80%+ gross margins
4. **No ad model**: Must charge users directly

## The Path to Profitability

| Phase | Timeline | Focus | Revenue |
|-------|----------|-------|---------|
| **Growth** | Now - 12mo | User acquisition, app ecosystem | $0-500K ARR |
| **Monetization** | 12-24mo | Ad rollout, premium tiers | $1-5M ARR |
| **Scale** | 24-36mo | International, enterprise | $10-50M ARR |
| **Profitability** | 36mo+ | Optimize unit economics | Cash flow positive |

**We're not burning cash to acquire users. Users come free through the app ecosystem.**
