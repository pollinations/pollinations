**What is now, where it's going — the gaming-first path**

---

## What Is Now

**We're the AI devkit powering Roblox hits.**

- 51M player visits on games we power
- 100M+ AI generations per month
- 40% month-over-month growth
- $12K+ first month revenue from games alone
- 15K+ Discord community of young devs

Gaming is our wedge. AI NPCs are the killer app. We're the infrastructure behind the hits.

## Where It's Going

**Gaming proves the model. Then we expand everywhere.**

### Phase 1: Gaming (Now)
- Roblox AI NPCs and quests
- Plug-and-play devkit + compute
- First revenue from games

### Phase 2: Platform Economies (6-12 months)
- Expand to all gaming platforms
- In-game creation tools ("in-Roblox vibe coder")
- Revenue sharing with developers

### Phase 3: AI Infrastructure (12-24 months)
- Full multi-modal platform (text, image, audio, video)
- "Unity for Gen-AI" — we handle identity, wallet, infra, monetization
- Millions of AI-native micro-apps

## The Big Vision

**A world where anyone can build AI-powered experiences.**

Not just enterprise studios. Not just people with credit cards. Anyone.

The 16-year-old in Brazil building the next hit Roblox game. The indie dev in Indonesia with a chatbot idea. The vibe coder who just wants to make something cool.

**We're the compute layer for the AI-native generation.**

Gaming is how we get there. Infrastructure is the destination.
