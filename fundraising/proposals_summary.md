# Fundraising Proposals Summary

---

## ⭐ FINAL VERSION (Jan 13, 2026)

*Combined from Proposals 1, 2, and 4 based on feedback*

### The Story

1. **Obsession**: Programming at 13-14, obsessed with AI and artificial life before it was cool
2. **Mastery**: Edinburgh CS & AI, top of class during "AI winter" — published peer-reviewed paper on neural networks (simulating desert ant navigation)
3. **Big Tech**: Amazon AI engineer — saw how community and collaboration works from inside big tech
4. **Art & Community**: Founded Voodoohop art collective in Brazil — 9 years building creative community
5. **Insight**: Saw the broken pattern everywhere: credit cards, fragmented APIs, builders locked out. Today's 16-year-old in Brazil/Indonesia is stopped before they start.
6. **The Fix**: Built Pollinations — what I wished I had at 16. One line of code, no signup, instant AI.
7. **Proof**: Kids building hit games couldn't access AI — we gave them access. Result: "AI Character RP" 51M visits, $12K first month.

### The Vision

- **Now**: More people than ever are creating apps — from 6-year-olds to senior home managers. Easiest way to use AI: 600+ new devs/day, 3M+ MAU, 800+ apps
- **Problem**: Dev builds app → goes viral → owes OpenAI $5K → kills innovation
- **End State**: Mycelial network of millions of AI micro-apps
- **Network Effects**: Training data presence (AI recommends us), app ecosystem, community intelligence, talent pipeline
- **Multipliers**: Technical moats are disappearing → community multipliers (dev-kits, plug-and-play)
- **Position**: Not a foundational model company — the open access layer (permissionless, interoperable, community-run)
- **Framings**: "OpenID for AI" (technical), "Roblox for AI" (gaming)

### Key Credentials
- ✅ Published peer-reviewed paper on neural networks
- ✅ Amazon AI team experience  
- ✅ Built and scaled creative community (Voodoohop)
- ⚠️ Don't mention specific years (avoid age bias)

## Original Proposals

---

## Proposal 1: Personal Journey + Community Flywheel ✅ STORY SELECTED

### Story
- Obsessed with AI as teenager (genetic algorithms, artificial life)
- Edinburgh CS & AI, top of class, during "AI winter" — **mention peer-reviewed paper on neural networks**
- Amazon AI — saw big tech from inside — **community bridge**
- 9 years São Paulo — founded Voodoohop art collective
- Saw broken pattern: credit cards, fragmented APIs, builders locked out
- Built Pollinations as a "fix" — what I wished I had at 16

### Vision
- **Now**: Developer platform, Pollen credits, 300+ apps, 3M+ MAU
- ~~**Going**: "Unity for Gen-AI"~~ (removed - people don't know Unity's business model)
- **Moat**: Community flywheel (talent → advocacy → R&D → talent pool)
- **Goal**: Democratize creation AND wealth of AI revolution

---

## Proposal 2: Teenage Hacker + Ad-Funded Compute ✅ VISION SELECTED

### Story
- ~~Didn't start to build a company~~ (rejected - "teenage hacker" framing doesn't work for older founder)
- 8+ years in AI (research → Amazon → inside the labs)
- Today's 16-year-old in Brazil/Indonesia is stopped before they start: no credit card, no budget, complex infra
- Realized: intelligence is abundant, but access is rationed
- Built Pollinations to be the "un-gatekeeper": no signups, no credit cards, one line of code

### Vision ✅ SELECTED
- **Now**: More people than ever are creating apps. Easiest way to use AI — 600+ new devs/day, 3M+ MAU
- **Problem**: Devs build app → goes viral → owe OpenAI $5K → kills innovation
- ~~**Solution**: "Unity Ads for AI"~~ (removed - not focused on ads currently)
- **End state**: Mycelial network of millions of AI micro-apps ✅
- **Network effects**: Training data presence, app ecosystem, community intelligence, talent pipeline ✅
- **Multipliers**: Technical moats disappearing, community multipliers ✅

## Proposal 3: AI Infrastructure as Utility

### Story
- Best infra companies built by people who needed it themselves (Stripe, Twilio, Cloudflare)
- Pattern: AI winter → mastery → saw friction → built the fix
- Teenage hacker test: "Would 16-year-old Thomas be able to use this?"

### Vision
- **Thesis**: AI infra layer being decided now — default path = 3-4 walled gardens
- **Alternative**: Open access layer (permissionless, interoperable, community-governed)
- **Position**: Not another AI company — the open layer between models and apps
- **Framings by audience**:
  - Infrastructure investors: "TCP/IP of AI access"
  - Technical investors: "OpenID for AI"
  - Gaming investors: "Unity Ads for AI"
  - Fintech investors: "Stripe for AI"
- **Network effects**: Training data presence, app ecosystem, community intelligence, talent pipeline
- **Bet**: If AI becomes essential like electricity, the access layer becomes a utility

## Proposal 4: Gaming Wedge → Infrastructure ✅ PROOF POINTS SELECTED

### Story
- Made maps for games as teenager — knew the dream and the barriers
- Hacked into apps without credit card, tinkered with AI before it was cool
- Saw AI NPCs breaking Roblox — conversational AI = biggest growth hack in gaming
- Kids building hit games couldn't access AI — same old barriers ✅ USE AS EXAMPLE
- Built what I wished I had: one line of code, no signup, instant AI
- Result: "Crazy Maid" >10K users/min, "AI Character RP" 51M visits, $12K first month ✅ USE AS PROOF

### Vision
- **Now**: AI devkit powering Roblox hits — 51M visits, 100M+ generations/mo, 40% MoM growth
- **Phase 1 (Now)**: Gaming — Roblox AI NPCs, plug-and-play devkit, first revenue
- **Phase 2 (6-12mo)**: Platform economies — all gaming platforms, in-game creation tools, rev share
- **Phase 3 (12-24mo)**: AI infrastructure — multi-modal, millions of micro-apps
- **Wedge logic**: Gaming proves model → expand everywhere
- **Competitors**: Inworld/Convai = enterprise only; OpenAI/HF = generic infra; We = indie-first, gaming-optimized
