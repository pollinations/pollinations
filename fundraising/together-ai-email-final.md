Subject: Re: Together AI Platform Services - Pollinations Usage Data

Hi Raj,

Following up on our call, here's a snapshot of our current platform usage at Pollinations.AI.

## Current Scale

We're processing **~2.5M requests daily** with steady week-over-week growth:

- **Image Generation**: ~577 RPM average (peak: 1,474 RPM) - our primary GPU workload
- **Text Models**: ~337 RPM average, processing ~26K tokens/sec (peak: 34K tokens/sec)
- **Total Load**: ~1,900 RPM sustained

## Developer Community & Growth

- **Total Developers**: 16,968 registered users in our system
- **New Developer Signups**: 3,175 last week (+19% WoW)
- **Weekly Active Developers**: 4,377 (+19% WoW)
- **Community**: 20K+ Discord members, 1,000+ published apps
- **Revenue**: $690 last week (we only recently introduced payments, so still early)

## Why Together AI is a Strong Fit

After reviewing your platform, we're particularly interested in your competitively-priced, state-of-the-art open source models:

1. **Multimodal Models** - FLUX.1 variants for high-volume image generation, DeepSeek-V3.1 and Qwen3 for text with large context windows

2. **Audio Generation** - MiniMax Speech 2.6 Turbo for TTS capabilities

3. **Image Editing** - Newer models like Qwen Image Edit

4. **Video Generation** - Kling, Wan 2.2, and other video models

## Infrastructure Needs

Beyond serverless inference, we're also interested in exploring:

- **Dedicated GPU Clusters** for self-deployment and fine-tuning workloads
- **Instant Clusters** for flexible scaling during peak demand
- **Custom model training** on H100/H200 infrastructure

Given your competitive pricing, model variety, and GPU infrastructure options (H100/H200 clusters), we could consider migrating a large part of our workloads to Together AI - both serverless inference and self-deployed GPU clusters for custom fine-tuning. The Build tier credits would give us significant runway to test integration and optimize costs during this growth phase.

Happy to discuss technical integration and how we can leverage your forward-deployed engineering support.

Best regards,

## Context & Notes

### Together AI Startup Accelerator Tiers

| Tier | Eligibility | Credits | Engineering Support |
|------|-------------|---------|---------------------|
| **Build** | Up to $5M raised | Up to $15K | 3 hours |
| **Grow** | $5M-$10M raised | Up to $30K | 6 hours |
| **Scale** | Over $10M raised | Up to $50K | 10 hours |

**Our Fit**: Build tier (haven't raised $5M yet)

### Key Metrics Included

- **Scale**: 2.5M requests/day, 1,900 RPM sustained
- **Growth**: 19% WoW across signups and active users
- **Community**: 20K Discord, 1K apps, 16,968 total developers
- **Revenue Context**: $690/week, recently introduced payments

### Models of Interest

**Image**: FLUX.1 (schnell/dev), Qwen Image Edit, ByteDance Seedream  
**Text**: DeepSeek-V3.1, Qwen3 235B  
**Audio**: MiniMax Speech 2.6 Turbo (TTS)  
**Video**: Kling, Wan 2.2  
**GPU**: H100/H200 clusters for fine-tuning and custom training

### Strategic Value

- **Cost Optimization**: FLUX schnell at $0.0027/MP is 10x cheaper than current mix
- **Credits Value**: $15K = ~5.5M images or ~29 days of current load
- **Infrastructure**: Both serverless + dedicated GPU clusters
- **Partnership**: 20K community, 1K apps = exposure for Together AI
