## Media Storage

Upload images, audio, and video and get back a unique id and URL. Each upload gets its own id (re-uploading the same bytes yields a new one).

Base URL: https://media.pollinations.ai

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `POST /upload` | Upload a file, receive a unique media URL |
| `GET /{id}` | Retrieve a previously uploaded file |
| `GET /{id}/metadata` | Get file metadata as JSON |
| `GET /media?tag={tag}` | List the public gallery for a tag (no auth) |
| `DELETE /media/{id}` | Delete a published item you own (secret `sk_` key) |
| `POST /s3/credentials` | Create a 15-minute, owner-scoped S3 session |

Upload requires an API key; retrieval is public. The decoded/file-size limit is 100MB for both upload formats. Files use a 30-day lifecycle from upload or the latest refresh. Retrieving the file body refreshes that lifecycle only when the object is at least 15 days old; metadata and HEAD requests do not refresh it. Two upload formats are accepted:

Multipart form (browsers, files on disk):

```bash
curl -X POST "https://media.pollinations.ai/upload" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F file=@path/to/image.png
```

Base64 JSON (programmatic callers that already hold the bytes):

```bash
curl -X POST "https://media.pollinations.ai/upload" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"data": "<base64-or-data-uri>", "contentType": "image/png", "name": "image.png"}'
```

**Tags publish (alpha).** An optional `tags` field (comma-separated string, or a JSON array in the JSON format) publishes the upload into each tag's public gallery, where anyone can list it via `GET /media?tag={tag}`. Untagged uploads stay unlisted — reachable only by their unguessable id URL. Full endpoint reference: https://media.pollinations.ai/openapi.json

## S3 clients

Exchange a Pollinations Bearer credential for temporary, prefix-scoped R2 credentials:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://media.pollinations.ai/s3/credentials" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

The response contains the S3 endpoint, public endpoint, region, bucket, required key prefix, and standard access key, secret key, and session token fields. Use them with any S3 client that supports temporary session credentials. Secret keys and agent run tokens receive read/write access to their owner's prefix. Objects stored below its `public/` folder are readable from the returned public endpoint without a token; other objects are not exposed there.
