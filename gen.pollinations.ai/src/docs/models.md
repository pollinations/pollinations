## Models

Discover available models with pricing, capabilities, and metadata. No authentication required.

| Endpoint | Returns |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /models` | All models with pricing, capabilities, and metadata |
| `GET /v1/models` | All models in OpenAI-compatible format (`{object: "list", data: [...]}`) |
| `GET /text/models` | Text models with pricing, context window, tool support |
| `GET /image/models` | Image & video models with capabilities and pricing |
| `GET /video/models` | Video models with capabilities and pricing |
| `GET /audio/models` | Audio models with supported voices |
| `GET /embeddings/models` | Embedding models with supported modalities |
| `GET /3d/models` | 3D Generation models with supported modalities |

### Query Parameters

All model discovery endpoints accept an optional `community` query parameter:

| Parameter | Values | Behaviour |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| *(omitted)* | | Returns all models (default, backward-compatible) |
| `community=false` | `false`, `0` | Excludes community models — returns official models only |
| `community=true` | `true`, `1` | Returns community models only |

Any other value (e.g. `tru`, `yes`, `2`) returns **400 Bad Request**.

Example: `GET /models?community=false`

Rich model endpoints include `capabilities` for agentic/model traits:
`tool_calling`, `reasoning`, `web_search`, and `code_execution`.
Modalities, video frame controls, voices, and context length remain separate
structured fields.

Use `supported_endpoints` to discover which public API routes accept each
model. `/v1/responses` identifies built-in models with a configured native
Responses route, community text models and endpoint agents whose owner supplied
the Responses API and one exact URL, and managed prompt agents. These community
models and agents also accept `/v1/chat/completions` through the shared adapter.
Built-in models may use separate upstream routes for Chat and Responses.
Supported media models also advertise both endpoints and return generated-file
links as assistant text. Reference-required models return their normal missing-input
error; use their native endpoint until attachments are supported here.

### Chat parameters

Official Chat models include:

- `supported_parameters`: verified generation controls honored through `/v1/chat/completions` on the model's primary route.
- `default_parameters`: scalar values Pollinations supplies when callers omit them, not upstream defaults.

These fields describe Pollinations' Chat behavior, not upstream defaults or the
native `/v1/responses` API. Unverified controls are omitted; inclusion does not
mean every value or combination is supported. Provider fallback routes can
have different controls and defaults. Community models omit both fields.
For example,
`openai/gpt-5.4` omits sampling controls because its Chat transform removes
them, while `openai/gpt-oss-20b` forwards `temperature` and `top_p`.
On `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6`, those two controls are mutually exclusive
(`temperature` wins), and both are disabled when `reasoning_effort` is enabled.
Newer Claude and Gemini models may omit sampling controls entirely. On
Sonnet 4.6, `response_format` supports `json_schema`, not `json_object`.
Reasoning effort levels and forced-tool restrictions remain model-specific.

## Community Models

Community models use an `owner/model` id and appear in the same discovery responses as Pollinations-operated models. Use `community=true` to return only community models or `community=false` to exclude them.
