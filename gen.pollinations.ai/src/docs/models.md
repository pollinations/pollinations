## Models

Discover available models with pricing, capabilities, and metadata. No authentication required.

| Endpoint | Returns |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /models` | All models with pricing, capabilities, and metadata |
| `GET /v1/models` | All models in OpenAI-compatible format (`{object: "list", data: [...]}`) |
| `GET /text/models` | Text models with pricing, context window, tool support |
| `GET /image/models` | Image & video models with capabilities and pricing |
| `GET /video/models` | Video models with capabilities and pricing |
| `GET /audio/models` | Audio models with supported voices |
| `GET /embeddings/models` | Embedding models with supported modalities |
| `GET /3d/models` | 3D Generation models with supported modalities |

### Query Parameters

All model discovery endpoints accept an optional `community` query parameter:

| Parameter | Values | Behaviour |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| *(omitted)* | | Returns all models (default, backward-compatible) |
| `community=false` | `false`, `0` | Excludes community models — returns official models only |
| `community=true` | `true`, `1` | Returns community models only |

Any other value (e.g. `tru`, `yes`, `2`) returns **400 Bad Request**.

Example: `GET /models?community=false`

Rich model endpoints include `capabilities` for agentic/model traits:
`tool_calling`, `reasoning`, `web_search`, and `code_execution`.
Modalities, video frame controls, voices, and context length remain separate
structured fields.

For Chat models, `supported_parameters` lists the parameters the model accepts
through Pollinations (after gateway transforms) and `default_parameters`
records the values applied when the caller omits them. Only parameters that
actually work are listed — parameters the gateway strips or the provider
silently ignores are omitted, and `condition` documents provider-specific
restrictions (e.g. mutual exclusion, gateway overrides). For example,
`openai/gpt-5.4-nano` locks `temperature` to `1`, and
`anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6` drops `top_p` whenever `temperature` is also set.
These fields describe Chat-completion behavior; they do not describe the native
Responses API (see `supported_endpoints` to find models with a direct
`/v1/responses` route).

Use `supported_endpoints` to discover which public API routes accept each
model. `/v1/responses` identifies built-in models with a configured native
Responses route, community text models and endpoint agents whose owner supplied
the Responses API and one exact URL, and managed prompt agents. These community
models and agents also accept `/v1/chat/completions` through the shared adapter.
Built-in models may use separate upstream routes for Chat and Responses.

## Community Models

Community models use an `owner/model` id and appear in the same discovery responses as Pollinations-operated models. Use `community=true` to return only community models or `community=false` to exclude them.
