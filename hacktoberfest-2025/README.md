# 🎃 Hacktoberfest 2025 Apps

Build cool **frontend-only** apps with Pollinations AI. Pure HTML/CSS/JS or React - no backend needed!

## What Goes Here?

Frontend apps that use Pollinations APIs (text/image generation). Each app gets its own folder.

**Two Types of Apps:**

### 1. **Pure HTML** (simplest)
- Single `index.html` file with inline CSS/JS
- No build step, just open in browser
- Perfect for quick tools and demos

### 2. **React + Vite** (for complex apps)
- Uses React for UI
- Vite for dev server and building
- Still frontend-only, no backend

**Requirements:**
- ✅ Actually works (no broken features)
- ✅ Has a README explaining what it does
- ✅ Uses Pollinations API meaningfully
- ✅ Frontend-only (no backend/server code)

**Bonus points:**
- 🔥 Auto-deployed preview (GitHub Pages)
- 🎨 Screenshots/GIFs
- 💯 Clean, readable code
- ✨ Does something unique

## Structure

### Pure HTML App:
```
hacktoberfest-2025/
├── your-app-name/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── index.html    # everything in one file
```

### React App:
```
hacktoberfest-2025/
├── your-app-name/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── vite.config.js
│   └── src/
│       └── App.jsx
```

## How to Submit

### Step 1: Propose Your App Idea (Recommended)

Before building, **create a GitHub issue** with your app idea:

1. Go to [Issues](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/issues/new)
2. Title: `[Hacktoberfest App] Your App Name`
3. Describe:
   - What your app does
   - Which Pollinations APIs you'll use (text/image)
   - Why it's useful/fun/interesting
4. Tag it with `hacktoberfest` label
5. Wait for feedback from maintainers

**Why propose first?**
- Get early feedback on your idea
- Avoid building something that won't be accepted
- Maintainers can suggest improvements
- Shows you're serious about contributing

### Step 2: Build Your App

Once your idea is approved (or if you're feeling confident):

1. Fork this repo
2. Create your app folder in `hacktoberfest-2025/`
3. Build something that actually works
4. Test it from a fresh clone (seriously, do this)
5. PR with title: `[Hacktoberfest] Add [App Name]`
6. Link to your original issue in the PR description
7. Tag it `hacktoberfest`
