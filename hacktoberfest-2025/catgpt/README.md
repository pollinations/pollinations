# 🐱 CatGPT Meme Generator

Transform your questions into sassy cat wisdom! A collaboration between [Pollinations.AI](https://pollinations.ai) and [Tanika Godbole](https://www.instagram.com/tanikagodbole/), the original creator of the CatGPT comic.

## 🌟 About

CatGPT is an AI-powered meme generator that creates personalized cat comics in response to your questions. Just like the original CatGPT comic, our feline friend responds with lazy, sarcastic wisdom while treating humans as mere servants.

This project emerged from a collaboration with Tanika Godbole, with the idea coming from Dr. Julia Degen. We're using OpenAI's GPT-Image-1 model through Pollinations.AI to democratize access to AI-generated cat wisdom!

### 🎨 Original Inspiration

The CatGPT concept was created by Tanika Godbole. Check out the [first CatGPT comic on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cn4OLhPyDLP/)!
