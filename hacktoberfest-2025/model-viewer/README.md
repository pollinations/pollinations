## Advanced Features Details

### Uptime Monitoring System
The app includes a sophisticated uptime monitoring system that:
- **Checks model availability** every 5 minutes automatically
- **Stores 48 data points** (4 hours of history with 5-minute intervals)
- **Displays status** with color-coded visual bars:
  - üü¢ Green: Model is available (up)
