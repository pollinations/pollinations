# 🎭 Opposite Prompt Generator

A fun and creative AI web app that transforms any image prompt into its **semantic opposite** — flipping key attributes like **age, gender, style, mood, setting, and subject matter** — and then generates the corresponding image using the [Pollinations API](https://pollinations.ai/).
