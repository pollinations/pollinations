# Pollinations Multimodal MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for the Pollinations APIs that enables AI assistants like Claude to generate images, text, and audio directly. This server follows the "thin proxy" design principle, focusing on minimal data transformation and direct communication through stdio.

## Features

- Generate image URLs from text prompts
- Generate actual images and return them as base64-encoded data
- Generate text responses from text prompts
- Generate audio (text-to-speech) from text prompts
- List available image and text generation models
- Support for multiple reference images in image generation
- STDIO transport for easy integration with MCP clients
- Simple and lightweight
- Compatible with the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## System Requirements

- **Node.js**: Version 14.0.0 or higher
  - For best performance, we recommend Node.js 16.0.0 or higher
  - Node.js versions below 16 use an AbortController polyfill

## Quick Start

The easiest way to use the MCP server:

```bash
# Run directly with npx (no installation required)
npx @pollinations/model-context-protocol
```

If you prefer to install it globally:

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @pollinations/model-context-protocol

# Run the server
pollinations-mcp
```

## Transport

The MCP server exclusively uses STDIO transport, which is ideal for local integrations and command-line tools:

```bash
# Run with STDIO transport
npx @pollinations/model-context-protocol
```

For MCP clients, connect using:

```bash
npx supergateway --stdio -- pollinations-mcp
```

## Claude Desktop Integration

To install the MCP server in Claude Desktop:

```bash
# Run the installation script
npx @pollinations/model-context-protocol install-claude-mcp
```

This script will automatically:
- Find the Claude Desktop configuration file for your OS
- Add the Pollinations MCP server to the configuration
- Configure it to use npx for easy updates

After installation, restart Claude Desktop and you can use commands like:
```
Generate an image of a sunset over the ocean using the Pollinations API.
```

## Alternative MCP Implementations

- **MCPollinations**: A community-maintained alternative MCP server supporting similar capabilities. Available at [GitHub](https://github.com/pinkpixel-dev/MCPollinations) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pinkpixel/mcpollinations).

## Troubleshooting

### "AbortController is not defined" Error

If you encounter this error when running the MCP server:

```
ReferenceError: AbortController is not defined
```

This is usually caused by running on an older version of Node.js (below version 16.0.0). Try one of these solutions:

1. **Update Node.js** (recommended):
   - Update to Node.js 16.0.0 or newer

2. **Use our polyfill** (automatic in version 1.0.6+):
   - Update to the latest version of the package:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @pollinations/model-context-protocol@latest
   # or run with npx
   npx @pollinations/model-context-protocol@latest
   ```

3. **Install AbortController manually**:
   - If for some reason the polyfill doesn't work:
   ```bash
   npm install node-abort-controller
   ```

### Check Your Node.js Version

To check your current Node.js version:

```bash
node --version
```

If it shows a version lower than 16.0.0, consider upgrading for best compatibility.

## Available Tools

The MCP server provides the following tools:

### Content Generation

1. `generateImageUrl` - Generates an image URL from a text prompt
2. `generateImage` - Generates an image and returns it as base64-encoded data
3. `respondAudio` - Generates an audio response to a text prompt
4. `sayText` - Generates speech that says the provided text verbatim
5. `generateText` - Generates text from a prompt using text models
6. `listModels` - Lists available models for image or text generation
