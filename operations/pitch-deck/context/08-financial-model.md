# 08 Financial Model (Illustrative)

## Baseline Projection (Ad-Funded Tiering Only - Q3 2025 to Q4 2026)

*This simplified monthly view shows the initial period focusing on Ad Revenue and reaching scale before introducing optional models.*

| Metric (Monthly)        | Q3 2025 | Q4 2025 | Q1 2026 | Q2 2026 | Q3 2026 | Q4 2026 |
|-------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| MAU (End-Users, EOP)    | 3.5M    | 4.0M    | 5.5M    | 7.0M    | 8.5M    | 10.0M   |
| Avg Monthly Ad Rev/User | €0.01   | €0.02   | €0.05   | €0.07   | €0.09   | €0.105  |
| **Gross Ad Revenue**    | **€35k**| **€80k**| **€275k**|**€490k**|**€765k**|**€1.05M**|
| Cloud Cost/User         | €0.03   | €0.03   | €0.028  | €0.028  | €0.025  | €0.025  |
| Cloud Costs             | €105k   | €120k   | €154k   | €196k   | €213k   | €250k   |
| Other OpEx (Team etc.)  | €80k    | €85k    | €90k    | €95k    | €100k   | €105k   |
| **Total Expenses**      | **€185k**| **€205k**| **€244k**|**€291k**|**€313k**|**€355k** |
| **Net Profit/(Loss)**   |**(€150k)**|**(€125k)**|**€31k** |**€199k**|**€452k**|**€695k** |
| Ad € / Cloud € Ratio    | 0.33    | 0.67    | 1.79    | 2.50    | 3.59    | 4.20    |

**Notes (Baseline):**
*   Assumes ad stack and dynamic tiering launch effectively Q1 2026, driving Ad Rev/User up.
*   OpEx grows moderately with team/scale.
*   Cloud costs per user decrease slightly with scale/optimization.
*   Break-even (Net Profit > 0) is achieved in Q1 2026 in this scenario based purely on Ad Revenue.

## Optional Models Rollout - Financial Impact (from Q2 2026)

*This section overlays the introduction of Creator Premium Subscriptions (Q2 '26) and Ad Rev-Share (Q3/Q4 '26) onto the baseline, targeting break-even by Dec 2026.*

**Assumptions (Overlay on Baseline):**
*   Premium Subs launch Q2 2026: 1% of Creators adopt by Q2 end (€10/mo sub).
*   Ad Rev-Share launches Q3 2026 (Beta), Q4 2026 (GA): 5% of Creators opt-in by Q4 end (taking 50% of their app's specific Ad Rev).
*   Assume Rev-Share Creators are average performers (their apps generate 5% of total Ad Rev).
*   OpEx increases slightly (+€10k/qtr from Q2 '26) for new systems/support.

| Metric (Monthly)                 | Q2 2026 (Premium Beta Start) | Q3 2026 (RevShare Beta Start) | Q4 2026 (All GA + Break-even Target) |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| MAU (End-Users, EOP)             | 7.0M                         | 8.5M                          | 10.0M                                |
| **Gross Ad Revenue** (Baseline)  | **€490k**                    | **€765k**                     | **€1.05M**                           |
| **Creator Premium Sub Rev**      | **€1.3k** (130 Creators)     | **€4k** (400 Creators)        | **€10k** (1k Creators)              |
| **Total Gross Revenue**          | **€491.3k**                  | **€769k**                     | **€1.06M**                           |
| Cloud Costs                      | €196k                        | €213k                         | €250k                                |
| Other OpEx (Team etc.)           | €105k (€95k+€10k)            | €110k (€100k+€10k)            | €115k (€105k+€10k)                   |
| Creator Ad Rev-Share Payout      | €0                           | **€19k** (50% of 5% AdRev)    | **€26k** (50% of 5% AdRev)         |
| **Total Expenses**               | **€301k**                    | **€342k**                     | **€391k**                            |
| **Net Profit/(Loss)**            | **€190.3k**                  | **€427k**                     | **€669k**                            |
| Target Break-Even Month        |                              |                               | **Dec 2026 (Achieved in Q1 2026)**   |

**Notes (Combined):**
*   Premium Sub revenue is initially small but grows.
*   Rev-Share payout directly reduces platform net profit, but assumed necessary for Creator retention/choice.
*   With these assumptions, break-even is still projected well before Dec 2026 due to strong Baseline Ad Revenue growth.
*   *Crucially, the model needs refinement based on real adoption rates of Premium/Rev-Share and their impact on Ad € / Cloud € tiering incentives.*

**Note:** Break-even is achieved when the "Ad € / Cloud € Ratio" is ≥ 1 (i.e., Ad Revenue from Ad Providers via End-User engagement in Creator apps fully covers the platform's Cloud Computing costs). In Phase 1, all ad revenue contributes to covering operational costs and enabling higher tiers/limits for Creator apps, with no direct cash payouts to Creators.

## Phase 2 Projection (Illustrative - Q2 2027+)

This projection assumes Phase 2 options are live: Creator Premium Subscriptions and optional 50/50 Creator Ad Revenue Share.

**Assumptions:**
*   MAU: 10 Million End-Users (driving Ad Revenue)
*   Total Active Creators: 20,000 (example)
*   Creators choosing Premium Subscription: 10% (2,000 Creators)
*   Avg. Premium Subscription Revenue per subscribing Creator/Month: €10.00
*   Ad Revenue per End-User/Month (Platform Gross): $0.1125 (€0.105 approx.) (from Phase 1 model)
*   Creators choosing Ad Rev-Share: 20% of the *remaining* 90% of Creators (i.e., 18% of total Creators = 3,600)
*   Average Ad Revenue attributable per app/Creator (for Rev-Share calc): Assumed proportional to MAU/Creator (highly variable)
*   Expenses scale +15% from Phase 1 base due to new systems (Billing, Payouts)

**Note on Phase 2 Break-even:** Complex. Depends on Creator adoption mix (Premium vs. Ad Rev-Share vs. Default Tiering), Premium pricing, Ad Revenue performance per app, and cost scaling. Platform is profitable if `Total Gross Revenue > Total Expenses + (Implicit cost of higher tiers for Phase 1 Creators)`.
