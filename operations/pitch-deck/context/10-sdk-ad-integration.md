# 10 SDK Ad Integration Guide

(Placeholder for Creator documentation)

This document will provide a quick-start guide for Creators on:

*   Integrating the Pollinations Ad SDK/plugin into their applications.
*   Choosing between default ad-funded tiering or opting into optional models (Premium Subscription or Ad Rev-Share) launching during 2026.
*   Monitoring their app's performance (relevant metrics like Ad € / Cloud € ratio for tiering) via a Creator Dashboard (to be developed).
*   Understanding how ad performance influences their app's operational tier and limits in the default model.
