## 🛠️ **COO | Elliot Fouchy**

* ⚡ **Oversees day-to-day engineering and production operations** — managing sprints, deployments, and incident response—while continually refining processes, dashboards, and OKRs to ensure the tech and production teams run smoothly and efficiently.
* 🤝 **Manages resources, vendor contracts, cost levers and strategic partnerships** — GPU / cloud capacity, ad-tech integrations and research collaborations—so spend and alliances stay tightly aligned with roadmap priorities.

* 💰 **Build rigorous financial discipline** — budgets, KPI dashboards and unit-economics models that safeguard net margins as usage scales.
* 🏛️ **Establish legal & governance foundations** — entity structure, IP strategy, data-privacy / ad-tech compliance, and the contracts powering rev-share and subscription plans.
* 🧑‍💼 **Design hiring plans, equity frameworks and culture rituals** that attract and retain top talent through rapid growth.
* 🛡️ **Own risk management and operational scalability,** embedding processes and tooling that de-risk market, technical and regulatory exposure across all roadmap phases.
