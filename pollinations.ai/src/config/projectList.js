// Project entries support an optional submissionDate field (format: "YYYY-MM-DD")
// This field is automatically added for new submissions but may not be present in older entries
// The date is not currently displayed in the UI but is recorded for future use
//
// Projects in non-English languages should include:
// - A country flag emoji in the name (e.g., 🇨🇳 for Chinese)
// - A "language" field with the appropriate language code
// - An English translation of the description in parentheses when possible
// 
// Projects can include a 'hidden' flag (hidden: true) to hide them from the README.md
// This is useful for projects that are broken or no longer maintained
// Hidden projects will still be available in the projectList.js but won't appear in the README
