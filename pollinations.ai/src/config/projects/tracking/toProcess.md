# Pollinations Projects Categorization Tracking

## Category Descriptions (from projectList.js)

- **Vibe Coding ‚ú®** (`vibeCoding.js`): "No-code / describe-to-code playgrounds and builders"
- **Creative üé®** (`creative.js`): "Turn prompts into images, video, music, design, slides"
- **Games üé≤** (`games.js`): "AI-powered play, interactive fiction, puzzle & agent worlds"
- **Hack-&-Build üõ†Ô∏è** (`hackAndBuild.js`): "SDKs, integration libs, extensions, dashboards, MCP servers"
- **Chat üí¨** (`chat.js`): "Standalone chat UIs / multi-model playgrounds"
- **Social Bots ü§ñ** (`socialBots.js`): "Discord / Telegram / WhatsApp / Roblox bots & NPCs"
- **Learn üìö** (`learn.js`): "Tutorials, guides, style books & educational demos"

## Important Notes
- Always check the project description and functionality against these category descriptions
- Don't rely solely on the category field in accumulated-projects.json
- Each project should only be in ONE category file
- Consider the actual purpose and functionality of the project when categorizing
- Some projects may fit better in categories different from their source JSON category
- Educational projects (like OkeyAI with African cultural awareness) belong in Learn category
- Chat interfaces and multi-model playgrounds belong in Chat category
- Social platform bots belong in Social Bots category

## Next Steps (Session Starting Point)

1. Continue processing uncategorized projects from the list below
2. All category files have been checked and no placeholder entries remain:
   - `/Users/thomash/Documents/GitHub/pollinations/pollinations.ai/src/config/projects/socialBots.js`
   - `/Users/thomash/Documents/GitHub/pollinations/pollinations.ai/src/config/projects/games.js`
   - `/Users/thomash/Documents/GitHub/pollinations/pollinations.ai/src/config/projects/vibeCoding.js`
   - `/Users/thomash/Documents/GitHub/pollinations/pollinations.ai/src/config/projects/learn.js`
   - `/Users/thomash/Documents/GitHub/pollinations/pollinations.ai/src/config/projects/chat.js`
   - `/Users/thomash/Documents/GitHub/pollinations/pollinations.ai/src/config/projects/hackAndBuild.js`
   - `/Users/thomash/Documents/GitHub/pollinations/pollinations.ai/src/config/projects/creative.js`
3. Focus on projects that need categorization (marked with "needs categorization")
4. Update this tracking file after each batch of projects is processed
5. Source of truth for project data: `/Users/thomash/Documents/GitHub/pollinations/project-recovery/accumulated-projects.json`

## Categorization Instructions

When assigning projects to categories, always:
- Use the most accurate fit based on project functionality and metadata.
- If a project fits multiple categories, prefer assigning it to less-populated categories (games, hackAndBuild, learn, socialBots, vibeCoding) to maintain balance across categories.
- Avoid duplicates and keep each project in only one category.
