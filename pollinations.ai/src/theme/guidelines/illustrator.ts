POLLINATIONS IDENTITY
This represents the interconnected web of AI and creativity.
Think: organic networks, biological systems, the beauty of natural communication.

Visual Language:
- Networks & connections: mycelium threads, neural pathways, constellation maps
- Organic nodes: cells, spores, pollen grains, seeds, dewdrops
- Growth patterns: branching, spiraling, radiating, blooming
- Symbiosis: elements in harmonious relationship

Shape Inspiration:
- Microscopic: cell structures, diatoms, radiolaria, pollen grains
- Botanical: flower cross-sections, seed pods, leaf venation, root systems
- Biological: neurons, synapses, organelles, DNA helices
- Natural phenomena: snowflakes, river deltas, coral formations

Technical Specs:
- Target resolution: 512x512px
- Clean lines that suggest organic forms
- SVG-friendly, scalable design
- Good contrast against various backgrounds

Style:
- Hyper beautiful, not clinical
- Suggests life, growth, connection
- Abstract but evocative
- Balanced asymmetry (like nature)
- Memorable and distinctive`;
