# Privacy Notice

**Scope.** This site presents the **pollinations.ai** open-source project and community. It does not offer commercial accounts or paid services.

**What we process (minimal):** standard service logs (IP, timestamps, user-agent), optional community identifiers (e.g., Discord username if you link a bot, GitHub handle if you contribute), and aggregated telemetry. Prompts/outputs in demo pages are processed **transiently** to render results and not retained beyond short-lived caches unless you choose to publish them.

**Why:** run the site, prevent abuse, improve reliability, and comply with the law (legitimate interests; contract where an account exists).

**Cookies:** only essential cookies. No non-essential analytics unless explicitly introduced (and then opt-in).

**Sharing:** service providers under confidentiality; authorities when required by law. We **do not sell** personal data.

**Rights & contact:** access, rectification, deletion, objection, portability, and withdrawal of consent (where used). Contact **[hi@myceli.ai](mailto:hi@myceli.ai)**. For full details, see the **[Myceli.AI Terms & Privacy](https://enter.pollinations.ai/terms)**.
