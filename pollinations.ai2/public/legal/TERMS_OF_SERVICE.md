pollinations.ai is an **open source**, **community-driven** production-ready infrastructure for running, routing, and scaling AI models. The codebase handles orchestration, load-balancing, and API-key storage.

We believe in:

**Open Source:**

- Contributions welcome!

> - The AI models we use have their own licenses. Check model licenses before commercial use.
> - This covers the non-commercial site and open-source code. Paid services are governed by the [Myceli.AI Terms](https://enter.pollinations.ai/terms).
