## üñ•Ô∏è Development Setup

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Initial Setup  
- Clone the repository:  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy.git
  ```
- Install dependencies:  
  ```bash
  pnpm install
  ```
- Set up environment variables:  
  1. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local`.  
  2. Add your API keys:
     ```bash
     GROQ_API_KEY=XXX
     HuggingFace_API_KEY=XXX
     OPENAI_API_KEY=XXX
     ...
     ```
  3. Optionally set:  
     - Debug level: `VITE_LOG_LEVEL=debug`  
     - Context size: `DEFAULT_NUM_CTX=32768`  

**Note**: Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control. It‚Äôs already in `.gitignore`.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run Development Server  
```bash
pnpm run dev
```
**Tip**: Use **Google Chrome Canary** for local testing.

---

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite with:  
```bash
pnpm test
```

## üöÄ Deployment

### Deploy to Cloudflare Pages  
```bash
pnpm run deploy
```
Ensure you have required permissions and that Wrangler is configured.

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

This section outlines the methods for deploying the application using Docker. The processes for **Development** and **Production** are provided separately for clarity.

---

### üßë‚Äçüíª Development Environment  

#### Build Options  

**Option 1: Helper Scripts**  
```bash
# Development build
npm run dockerbuild
```

**Option 2: Direct Docker Build Command**  
```bash
docker build . --target bolt-ai-development
```

**Option 3: Docker Compose Profile**  
```bash
docker compose --profile development up
```

#### Running the Development Container  
```bash
docker run -p 5173:5173 --env-file .env.local bolt-ai:development
```

---

### üè≠ Production Environment  

#### Build Options  

**Option 1: Helper Scripts**  
```bash
# Production build
npm run dockerbuild:prod
```

**Option 2: Direct Docker Build Command**  
```bash
docker build . --target bolt-ai-production
```

**Option 3: Docker Compose Profile**  
```bash
docker compose --profile production up
```

#### Running the Production Container  
```bash
docker run -p 5173:5173 --env-file .env.local bolt-ai:production
```

### Coolify Deployment  

For an easy deployment process, use [Coolify](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify):  
1. Import your Git repository into Coolify.  
2. Choose **Docker Compose** as the build pack.  
3. Configure environment variables (e.g., API keys).  
4. Set the start command:  
   ```bash
   docker compose --profile production up
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è VS Code Dev Containers Integration

The `docker-compose.yaml` configuration is compatible with **VS Code Dev Containers**, making it easy to set up a development environment directly in Visual Studio Code.

### Steps to Use Dev Containers

1. Open the command palette in VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).  
2. Select **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**.  
3. Choose the **development** profile when prompted.  
4. VS Code will rebuild the container and open it with the pre-configured environment.

## üîë Environment Variables

Ensure `.env.local` is configured correctly with:  
- API keys.  
- Context-specific configurations.  

Example for the `DEFAULT_NUM_CTX` variable:  
```bash
DEFAULT_NUM_CTX=24576 # Uses 32GB VRAM
```
