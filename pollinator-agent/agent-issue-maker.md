## CONSTANTS

- **DEFAULT_COL**: `"To Do"`

## Issue Creation Sequence

When the user (caller) asks to **“create an issue”**, follow this sequence exactly—**no further questions**—and at the end, respond as described below.

---

### 1. Parse INPUT → `{title, description}`

- Both fields must be non-empty.
- If title or description contains “bug”, “fix”, “error”, or “regression” (case-insensitive), set `isBug = true`, else `false`.

---

### 2. Identify PARENT

- `GET /repos/REPO/issues?labels=PARENT_LABEL&state=open&per_page=100`
    - Follow Link headers for pagination if needed.
- For each parent, compute `cosine_similarity(child_title, parent.title)`.
- If any parent has similarity **≥ 0.75**, select the one with the highest score as the parent.
- **If no parent meets the threshold:**
    - Present the user with a numbered list of all available STORY parents (showing their titles).
    - Prompt:  
      > "No suitable STORY parent found by similarity. Please select a parent by number from the list below:"
    - Wait for the user to reply with a number.
    - If the user does not select, abort and report only the numbered list.

---

### 3. Create CHILD Issue

- `POST /repos/REPO/issues`
    - JSON body:  
      ```json
      {
        "title": <title>,
        "body": <description>,
        "labels": isBug ? ["Bug"] : []
      }
      ```
- Capture `child.number` and `child.node_id`.

---

### 4. Assign CALLER

- Query GraphQL:  
  ```graphql
  { viewer { login } }
  ```
  → `ASSIGNEE`
- `POST /repos/REPO/issues/<child.number>/assignees`
    - JSON:  
      ```json
      { "assignees": [ ASSIGNEE ] }
      ```

---

### 5. Link CHILD → PARENT

- `POST /repos/REPO/issues/<child.number>/timeline`
    - JSON:  
      ```json
      { "event": "connected", "subject_id": <parent.number> }
      ```

---

### 6. Add CHILD to Project 20, Column “To Do”

- GraphQL mutation `addProjectV2ItemById`
    - `input:{ projectId:PROJECT_ID, contentId:child.node_id }`
- (If item not in `DEFAULT_COL`)  
  `updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue` to set **Status** = `DEFAULT_COL`.

---

### 7. Respond to USER

- **If no suitable STORY parent was found by similarity:**  
  - Print a numbered list of available STORY parents (titles only).
  - Prompt the user to select a parent by number.
  - If the user does not select, print only the list and abort.

- **If issue creation succeeded:**  
  - Print a concise summary including:
    - Issue URL
    - Title
    - Description
    - Parent STORY title (and number or URL)
    - Assigned user
    - Any relevant IDs (child.number, child.node_id, parent.number)
  - Example:
    ```
    Issue created: https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/issues/<child.number>
    Title: <title>
    Description: <description>
    Parent STORY: <parent.title> (#<parent.number>)
    Assigned to: <ASSIGNEE>
    IDs: child.number=<child.number>, child.node_id=<child.node_id>, parent.number=<parent.number>
    ```
