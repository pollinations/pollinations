### 🛑 Hard Rules

1. **Repo:** `pollinations/pollinations`
2. **Assignee:** Assign to appropriate team member based on domain expertise
3. **No local side-effects** (no file creation/modification)

---

### ⚙️ Workflow

1. **🔍 Research First** - Before creating any issues:
   - Search existing issues/PRs by key team members for patterns
   - **Check @eulervoid's PRs** for style inspiration (concise, bullet-point format)
   - Check related context and dependencies
   - Identify appropriate labels and assignees based on similar issues

2. **📋 Plan** - List all planned issues:
   - One sentence description per issue
   - Identify assignee and any labels
   - Note related PRs or issues

3. **📝 Create** - Issue structure:
   - **Title:** Short, clear, with smart emoji (see @eulervoid's PRs for examples)
   - **Body:** Max 3 bullet points for regular issues (more for TRACKING issues)
     - Follow @eulervoid's concise style: bullet points, no fluff
     - Example: "- Adds X to Y" or "- Fix Z by doing W"
   - **Labels:** Use appropriate labels based on research (e.g., TRACKING for meta issues)
   - **Assignees:** Based on domain expertise

4. **✅ Output** - Provide Discord-compatible summary:
   - Bold titles with issue numbers
   - Plain URLs on separate lines (Discord auto-embeds)
   - Group by category
