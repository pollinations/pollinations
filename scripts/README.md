# Scripts Directory

This directory contains automation scripts for the Pollinations project.

## Scripts

- `updateStarCounts.js` - Updates star counts for projects
- `validateProjectData.js` - Validates project data integrity  
- `processProjectSubmission.js` - Processes new project submissions
- `migrateProjects.js` - Migrates project data structure
- `generateReadme.js` - Generates documentation

All scripts are configured to work with ES modules and have proper UTF-8 encoding.

## Encoding Fix

Scripts have been updated to use clean UTF-8 encoding without BOM to resolve GitHub Actions execution issues.
