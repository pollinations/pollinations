# Social Media Posting Schedule
# All times in UTC
# Used by buffer_publish.py to schedule posts via Buffer's customScheduled mode
#
# Each post is generated once, reviewed via PR, and delivered once at the preferred time.
# Generation frequency = delivery frequency. Lookback window matches the gap between generations.

# ── Daily platforms (via Buffer) ─────────────────────────────────────
# Generated every day at 00:00 UTC (generate_daily.py).
# Published on daily PR merge (publish_daily.py) → Buffer delivers at preferred time.
# No daily posts on Fridays — weekly replaces them.

twitter:
  # Daily (except Friday — weekly covers it)
  days: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]  # Mon-Thu + Sat-Sun (1=Monday, 7=Sunday)
  preferred: "15:00"  # 15:00 UTC

instagram:
  # Daily (except Friday — weekly covers it)
  days: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]  # Mon-Thu + Sat-Sun
  preferred: "15:00"  # 15:00 UTC

# ── Daily platforms (not via Buffer) ─────────────────────────────────
# Reddit daily: handled by TypeScript app at 15:00 UTC (not this Python pipeline)
# Discord daily: realtime per-PR webhook only (publish_realtime.py)

# ── Weekly (Friday 15:00 UTC) ────────────────────────────────────────
# All 5 platforms publish the weekly digest on Friday afternoon.
# Generated Thursday 00:00 UTC (generate_weekly.py) → PR for review.
# Published Friday 15:00 UTC (publish_weekly.py cron) if PR was merged.

weekly:
  days: [5]  # Friday only
  preferred: "15:00"  # 15:00 UTC — EU afternoon + US morning

# ── Non-social outputs (repo artifacts, not scheduled via Buffer) ────
#
# diary:
#   Generated during daily summary (generate_daily.py, 00:00 UTC cron).
#   Whimsical pixel art narrative of the day's gists → social/news/daily/{date}/diary.json
#
# highlights:
#   Updated on daily PR merge (publish_daily.py).
#   AI distills summary arcs into curated highlights → social/news/highlights.md
#
# readme:
#   Updated on daily PR merge (publish_daily.py).
#   Injects top 10 highlights into README.md "## 🆕 Latest News" section.

# How it works:
# Daily:
# 1. 00:00 UTC cron generates daily posts (X, IG, Reddit) → creates PR
# 2. PR merged → publish_daily.py stages X + IG to Buffer for 15:00 UTC delivery
# 3. Reddit daily is handled separately by TypeScript app at 15:00 UTC
# 4. Discord posts realtime per-PR (not daily summary)
#
# Weekly:
# 1. Thursday 00:00 UTC cron generates weekly summary → creates PR
# 2. PR reviewed and merged before Friday 15:00 UTC
# 3. Friday 15:00 UTC cron publishes all 5 platforms:
#    Buffer (X, LI, IG) + Reddit API + Discord webhook
