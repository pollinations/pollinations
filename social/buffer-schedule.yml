# Social Media Posting Schedule
# All times in UTC
# Used by buffer_publish_post.py to schedule posts via Buffer API

linkedin:
  # Best times for B2B/tech content on LinkedIn
  days: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Monday-Friday (1=Monday, 7=Sunday)
  times:
    - "09:00"  # 9am UTC (morning EU, early US East)
    - "14:00"  # 2pm UTC (afternoon EU, morning US East)
  preferred: "09:00"  # Default if multiple options

twitter:
  # Twitter engagement peaks
  days: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  # Every day
  times:
    - "12:00"  # Noon UTC
    - "16:00"  # 4pm UTC
    - "20:00"  # 8pm UTC
  preferred: "16:00"  # Default if multiple options

# How scheduling works:
# 1. PR merged → Buffer publish workflow triggers
# 2. Script reads this config
# 3. Calculates next available slot (day + time)
# 4. Calls Buffer API with scheduled_at timestamp
# 5. Buffer posts at that exact time
