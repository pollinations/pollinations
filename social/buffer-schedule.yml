# Social Media Posting Schedule
# All times in UTC
# Used by buffer_publish.py to schedule posts via Buffer's customScheduled mode
#
# Each post is generated once, reviewed via PR, and delivered once at the preferred time.
# Generation frequency = delivery frequency. Lookback window matches the gap between generations.

# How it works:
# Daily:
# 1. Cron generates post → creates PR for review
# 2. PR merged → Buffer publish workflow triggers
# 3. buffer_publish.py reads this schedule, picks next valid day at preferred time
# 4. Buffer delivers the post at that scheduled time
# 5. Reddit is posted immediately via API (not Buffer)
#
# Weekly:
# 1. Sunday 00:00 UTC cron generates weekly summary → creates PR for review
# 2. PR reviewed and merged before Monday 08:00 UTC
# 3. Monday 08:00 UTC cron stages X/LI/IG via Buffer + posts to Discord webhook
