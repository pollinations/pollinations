# Social Media Posting Schedule
# All times in UTC
# Used by buffer_stage_post.py to schedule posts via Buffer's customScheduled mode
#
# Each post is generated once, reviewed via PR, and delivered once at the preferred time.
# Generation frequency = delivery frequency. Lookback window matches the gap between generations.

# How it works:
# 1. Cron generates post → creates PR for review
# 2. PR merged → Buffer publish workflow triggers
# 3. buffer_stage_post.py reads this schedule, picks next valid day at preferred time
# 4. Buffer delivers the post at that scheduled time
