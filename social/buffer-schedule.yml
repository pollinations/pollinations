# Social Media Posting Schedule
# All times in UTC
# Used by buffer_publish.py to schedule posts via Buffer's customScheduled mode
#
# Each post is generated once and delivered once at the preferred time.
# Buffer staging happens immediately after generation (PUBLISH_MODE=buffer).
# Direct channels (Reddit, Discord) publish via separate cron (PUBLISH_MODE=direct).

#
# NEWS_summary.yml — daily 06:00 UTC cron:
#   Mon-Sat: generate_daily.py → commit to news → stage X + IG to Buffer → README PR to main
