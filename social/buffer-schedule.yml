# Social Media Posting Schedule
# All times in UTC
# Used by buffer_publish.py to schedule posts via Buffer's customScheduled mode
#
# Each post is generated once, reviewed via PR, and delivered once at the preferred time.
# Generation frequency = delivery frequency. Lookback window matches the gap between generations.

# ── Daily platforms (via Buffer) ─────────────────────────────────────
# Generated Mon-Sat at 06:00 UTC (generate_daily.py).
# Published on daily PR merge (publish_daily.py) → Buffer delivers at preferred time.
# No daily posts on Sundays — weekly replaces them.

# How it works (3 workflows):
#
# NEWS_pr_gist.yml — on every PR merge:
#   generate_realtime.py creates gist JSON + pixel art image
#   publish_realtime.py posts to Discord
#
# NEWS_summary.yml — daily 06:00 UTC cron:
#   Mon-Sat: generate_daily.py → X, IG, Reddit posts + highlights + README → PR
#   Sunday:  generate_weekly.py → X, LI, IG, Reddit, Discord posts → PR
#
# NEWS_publish.yml — on daily PR merge + Sunday 18:00 UTC cron:
#   Daily:  publish_daily.py stages X + IG to Buffer, deploys Reddit to VPS
#   Weekly: publish_weekly.py stages X + LI + IG to Buffer, deploys Reddit, posts Discord
