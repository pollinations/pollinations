# Social Media Posting Schedule
# All times in UTC
# Used by buffer_publish.py to schedule posts via Buffer's customScheduled mode
#
# Each post is generated once, reviewed via PR, and delivered once at the preferred time.
# Generation frequency = delivery frequency. Lookback window matches the gap between generations.

# ── Daily platforms (via Buffer) ─────────────────────────────────────
# Generated Mon-Sat at 06:00 UTC (generate_daily.py).
# Published on daily PR merge (publish_daily.py) → Buffer delivers at preferred time.
# No daily posts on Sundays — weekly replaces them.

twitter:
  # Daily (except Sunday — weekly covers it)
  days: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  # Mon-Sat (1=Monday, 7=Sunday)
  preferred: "15:00"  # 15:00 UTC

instagram:
  # Daily (except Sunday — weekly covers it)
  days: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  # Mon-Sat

# ── Daily platforms (not via Buffer) ─────────────────────────────────
# Reddit daily: handled by TypeScript app at 15:00 UTC (not this Python pipeline)
# Discord daily: realtime per-PR webhook only (publish_realtime.py)

# ── Weekly (Sunday 18:00 UTC) ──────────────────────────────────────
# All 5 platforms publish the weekly digest on Sunday evening.
# Generated Sunday 06:00 UTC (generate_weekly.py) → PR for review.

# How it works:
# Daily:
# 1. 06:00 UTC cron (Mon-Sat) generates daily posts (X, IG, Reddit) → creates PR
# 2. PR merged → publish_daily.py stages X + IG to Buffer for 15:00 UTC delivery
# 3. Reddit daily is handled separately by TypeScript app at 15:00 UTC
# 4. Discord posts realtime per-PR (not daily summary)
#
# Weekly:
# 1. Sunday 06:00 UTC cron generates weekly summary → creates PR
# 2. PR reviewed and merged before Sunday 18:00 UTC
# 3. Sunday 18:00 UTC cron publishes all 5 platforms:
#    Buffer (X, LI, IG) + Reddit API + Discord webhook
