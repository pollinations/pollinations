  "strategy_reasoning": "Using the 'Cozy Pixel Art' aesthetic aligns perfectly with the brand's 'friendly, approachable, indie-dev' identity. By visualizing technical updates (like BYOP and architecture diagrams) as retro game items or cozy garden elements, we make complex dev-logs feel welcoming and nostalgic. The lime green and pastel palette ensures brand consistency while tapping into the popular 'cozy gaming' trend (Stardew Valley/Unpacking).",
