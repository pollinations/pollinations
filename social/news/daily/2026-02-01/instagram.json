The flowers are blooming in lime green (#ecf874) and soft pinks. Background is a soft pastel gradient (lavender to peach) representing a sunrise. Chunky retro sprites, warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley or A Short Hike. Pixel font text floating in the air: 'GARDEN UPGRADE'. Nostalgic, peaceful, and emotionally warm.",

We just swapped our old watering system (Cloudflare cron) for some shiny new automation (GitHub Actions)! 🚿✨\n\nNow our ecosystem stays blooming 24/7 with smoother updates and better reliability. It's all about setting up the right tools so we can focus on planting new seeds (features) for you all.\n\nBuilding in public means constantly pruning and improving. What tools do you use to automate your workflow? Let us know! 👇\n\n#pollinations #opensource #githubactions #devlife #digitalgarden #pixelart #cozyvibes #8bit #indiedev",
