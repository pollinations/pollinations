No more deleting keys just to pause them.\n\n🗺️ **Routing Updates**\nMigrated midijourney to GPT-5.2 and moved some heavy lifting to Azure-2 for better stability.\n\n📊 **Merchant Stats**\nUpdated the provider costs dashboard with better alerting and daily net balance views.\n\nPlus, we fixed a path in the README so your map actually leads somewhere. 🗺️\n\nStay cozy and keep building! 🌸🐝\n\n#pollinations #opensource #pixelart #indiedev #retrogaming #8bit #buildinpublic #cozyvibes",
