  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art dev meme infographic showing Google Summer of Code preparation. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Large chunky pixel headline reads 'GSoC PREP'. Retro UI panels display 'Docs Updated' and 'Mentors Ready'. The cute pixel art bee mascot with a yellow body and dark brown horizontal stripes, small black legs, two black antennae, black vertical oval eyes, bright pink rectangular blush marks on cheeks, a small happy smile, and small rounded light blue translucent wings. She is wearing a tiny pixelated graduation cap and holding a quill, hovering over a large open pixel book. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley or A Short Hike. Readable at mobile size. Cozy pixel art, 8-bit aesthetic, soft pastel gradients, warm lighting, retro gaming vibes.",
  "body": "We've been doing some housekeeping to get the repo ready for Google Summer of Code. Just merged updates to our contributing guidelines and fixed up mentor contact info to make the onboarding process smoother for new contributors.\n\nIf you're a student looking into GenAI projects or just want to see how an open-source AI platform runs under the hood, the documentation should be much clearer now. We're building this in the open, so feel free to jump in and take a look.",
  "reasoning": "This post signals that the project is active, welcoming to new contributors, and organized enough to participate in GSoC. It appeals to the Reddit dev demographic (students and mentors) without being a sales pitch. The image uses the 'graduation' trope to visually communicate education and readiness."
