  "title": "Prep for Google Summer of Code: Updated contributing docs and mentor info",
  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art garden scene showing the Pollinations bee mascot preparing a garden bed. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. The bee is holding a pixelated rake, smoothing out soil labeled 'DOCS' and 'GUIDES'. A wooden signpost reads 'GSoC PREP' in chunky pixel font. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Mood: productive, welcoming, wholesome. No realistic textures.",
  "body": "Just merged a couple of housekeeping PRs to get the repo ready for Google Summer of Code (GSoC).\n\nWe've updated the `GSOC_README` and `CONTRIBUTING` guides to make the onboarding process smoother for students and new contributors. Also fixed up some mentor contact details so inquiries don't end up in a void.\n\nIf you're looking to contribute or participate in GSoC with us, the documentation should be much clearer now. As always, everything is open source.",
  "reasoning": "GSoC is a high-interest topic for the Reddit developer community (especially r/opensource or r/learnprogramming types). Focusing on 'preparing the soil' aligns perfectly with the brand metaphor while communicating a concrete administrative update that signals the project is active and welcoming to new contributors."
