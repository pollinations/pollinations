  "image_prompt": "[Pixel art dev meme infographic] showing a retro RPG quest board scene. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Large chunky pixel headline on a wooden signpost reads 'GSOC READY'. The pollinations.ai Bee mascot, wearing a tiny pixelated wizard hat, is unfurling a scroll labeled 'NEW DOCS'. Background details include pixelated flowers and a 'Welcome' mat. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Mood: welcoming, adventure-ready, wholesome.",
  "body": "We just merged a patch (#7877) specifically to streamline our documentation for Google Summer of Code. The README and contributing guidelines have been updated to make onboarding smoother for incoming students and new contributors.\n\npollinations.ai is fully open-source, and we want the barrier to entry to be as low as possible. Whether you're aiming for a GSoC slot or just want to submit your first PR, the updated docs should help you get the local dev environment running with less friction.\n\nThe codebase is open. If you run into issues setting up, let us know—we want to fix those gaps.",
  "reasoning": "This post targets the student/junior developer demographic prevalent on Reddit. By focusing on GSoC (a high-interest topic) and improved documentation (a universal pain point), it signals that the project is active, welcoming, and organized without sounding like a product ad."
