  "title": "Weekly Update: Added LTX-2 & Imagen 3, upgraded Claude, and migrated Mistral to OVH",
  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art dev meme infographic — retro RPG 'New Gear Acquired' screen. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and warm cream background. Headline 'WEEKLY LOOT' in chunky pixel font. Three retro inventory slots displaying pixel icons: a film reel labeled 'LTX-2', a brain labeled 'Claude 4.6', and a cloud labeled 'Mistral OVH'. Bee mascot is equipping the items. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Readable at mobile size. Nostalgic, nerdy, and clean.",
  "body": "Just shipped 8 merged PRs this week. Here is the breakdown of what is new in the repo:\n\n*   **New Models:** Added LTX-2 for video generation and api.airforce models (Imagen 3 & Grok Imagine Video).\n*   **Upgrades:** Bumped `claude-large` from Opus 4.5 to 4.6.\n*   **Infrastructure:** Migrated Mistral to OVHcloud to fix reliability issues and resolved a config key mismatch that was breaking the endpoint.\n*   **Sustainability:** We moved 5 high-compute models to the paid tier to ensure we can keep the core infrastructure free and queue-free for everyone else.\n\nCode is live on GitHub. As always, feedback on the new video models is welcome.",
  "reasoning": "The title is purely factual, avoiding clickbait. The body focuses on the technical 'what' and 'why'—specifically addressing the infrastructure changes and model swaps transparently. The RPG inventory image fits the 'dev meme' requirement while clearly displaying the new features as 'loot' for the user."
