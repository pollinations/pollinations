The toolbox is looking STACKED with Imagen-4, Flux-2-dev, and Grok-video all live now. Plus, we added ElevenLabs so your projects can finally find their voice 🗣️🎶\n\nFor our dev besties—we smoothed out the pathways. Portkey gateway is cozy on its own domain now, and we squashed those HMR bugs for our GSOC applicants. The code is flowing as smooth as honey. 🍯\n\nCome build something weird and beautiful.\n\nLink in bio to play! 🐝\n\n#pollinations #opensource #pixelart #aiart #grok #elevenlabs #indiedev #cozyvibes #generativeai #buildinpublic #8bit #retrogaming",
