  "title": "Update: Added ElevenLabs, Imagen 4, and Grok Video endpoints",
  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art dev meme infographic showing a 'NEW MODELS ADDED' update. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Large chunky pixel headline reads 'AUDIO + VIDEO + IMAGE'. Three retro game UI panels displaying pixel icons: a microphone (ElevenLabs), a film strip (Grok Video), and a digital canvas (Imagen/Flux). The main character is a cute pixel art bee mascot with a round chubby yellow body and dark brown horizontal stripes, small black legs, two black antennae, black vertical oval eyes, bright pink rectangular blush marks on cheeks, a small happy smile, and small rounded light blue translucent wings. The bee is wearing large pixel headphones and holding a movie clapperboard. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Readable at mobile size.",
  "body": "Just pushed a batch of new model endpoints to the API. You can now access ElevenLabs for TTS, plus Imagen 4, Flux 2 Dev, and Grok Video for generation. \n\nWe also moved the LLM gateway to a custom domain to improve reliability and patched some scroll behavior issues on the showcase pages. \n\nAs always, the repo is open if you want to see how we handle the model switching/routing.",
  "reasoning": "The title is purely factual and hits high-interest keywords (ElevenLabs, Grok) immediately. The body is concise, explaining exactly what shipped without marketing fluff. The image uses the 'inventory/update' gaming trope to visually categorize the new media types (audio, video, image) while maintaining the cozy, approachable brand identity."
