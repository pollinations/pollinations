  "title": "Update: Added ElevenLabs TTS, Imagen 4, Flux 2, and Grok Video support",
  "image_prompt": "[Pixel art dev meme infographic] showing a retro RPG 'Level Up' screen. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Large chunky pixel headline reads 'NEW MODELS'. Three retro UI panels displaying: 'ElevenLabs TTS', 'Imagen 4 + Flux 2', 'Grok Video'. The cute pixel art bee mascot (round yellow body, brown stripes, pink blush) is celebrating with a pixelated microphone in one hand. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Composition: Central stats for readability on mobile. Mood: Joyful, nerdy, community-focused.",
  "body": "Just merged 4 PRs today to expand the available endpoints on the platform.\n\n**What's New:**\n*   **Audio:** Added ElevenLabs TTS endpoint (#7281)\n*   **Visuals:** Added support for Imagen-4, Flux-2-Dev, and Grok-Video (#8063)\n*   **Infra:** Moved Portkey gateway to custom domain (#8053)\n*   **Fixes:** Patch for GSOC HMR page route changes (#8026)\n\nEverything is live now. As always, the code is open source if you want to see how the integrations work or contribute to the next batch.",
  "reasoning": "Focuses purely on the high-value model additions which are 'candy' for developers. The tone is objective and changelog-style, avoiding marketing fluff. The image uses the mandatory cozy pixel style but frames it as a 'Level Up' moment, which resonates with the gaming-adjacent dev culture on Reddit."
