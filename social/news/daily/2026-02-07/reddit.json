  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art dev meme infographic — retro RPG 'New Skills Unlocked' screen. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Headline 'NEW MODELS UNLOCKED' in chunky pixel font. Retro inventory slots containing pixel icons: a paintbrush (Flux/Imagen), a film strip (Grok), and a sound wave (ElevenLabs). Bee mascot wearing a tiny wizard hat hovering near the slots. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Readable at mobile size, joyful and nerdy.",
  "body": "Just merged support for a new batch of creative models into the Pollinations API.\n\nNew endpoints available today:\n- **Imagen 4** & **Flux 2 Dev** for image generation\n- **Grok Video (Alpha)** for video generation\n- **ElevenLabs** for text-to-speech\n\nWe also moved the Portkey gateway to a custom domain to handle the traffic better and patched some navigation scroll issues for our GSoC contributors.\n\nAs always, the API remains free and open-source. No keys required for the basic tier. You can check the implementation in PR #8063 and #7281 on GitHub.\n\nLet us know if you hit any rate limits with the new video endpoints; they are still in alpha.",
  "reasoning": "This update is feature-heavy, so the Reddit post focuses entirely on the new capabilities (models) which are high-value to developers. The RPG 'unlock' visual metaphor gamifies the update in a way that resonates with the dev/gaming demographic of Reddit without feeling corporate."
