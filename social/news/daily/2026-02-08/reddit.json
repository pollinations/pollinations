  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art dev meme infographic — retro recording studio screen. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Large chunky pixel headline reads 'AUDIO SUITE'. Retro UI panels show: 'Music Gen', 'Whisper STT', 'TTS v3', 'Polly Bot Code'. The cute pixel art bee mascot wears large headphones and adjusts a slider on a pixelated mixing desk. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Readable at mobile size. Cozy pixel art, 8-bit aesthetic, soft pastel gradients, warm lighting, retro gaming vibes.",
  "body": "We merged 14 PRs this week focusing heavily on audio capabilities and community tools.\n\n**Audio Suite Expansion:**\n- **Music Generation:** Added elevenmusic model with duration-based billing.\n- **Speech-to-Text:** Integrated OVH Whisper for transcription.\n- **TTS Upgrade:** Moved from eleven_multilingual_v2 to eleven_v3 for better synthesis.\n- **Proxy:** Added /audio/models endpoint for easier discovery.\n\n**Open Source & Frontend:**\n- **Polly Source Code:** The code for our Discord bot is now public (#8078) for anyone wanting to build their own agent.\n- **Frontend:** Redesigned the Play page and Dashboard for better UX.\n- **Optimizations:** Fixed aspect ratio clamping on klein-9b and aligned gemini-search registry with actual costs.\n\nEverything is live now. As always, feedback on the new audio models is appreciated.",
  "reasoning": "This post focuses purely on the 'shipping' aspect, which resonates with Reddit's builder/dev audience. It highlights the new technical capabilities (Audio) and the open-source contribution (Discord bot code) without marketing fluff. The image serves as a quick visual changelog in the required cozy pixel art style."
