Follow the shared visual style.",
  "body": "This week we merged 14 pull requests, focusing heavily on expanding audio capabilities and refining the developer experience.\n\nThe audio stack received a significant overhaul. We integrated OVH Whisper for speech-to-text, added the elevenmusic model for generation, and upgraded our Text-to-Speech engine to eleven_v3. To support this, we exposed a new /audio/models endpoint and updated the permission structures.\n\nOn the frontend, we shipped a redesign of the Dashboard and Play pages to better accommodate these new audio workflows. We also released Polly, a new Discord bot source, and pushed optimizations for image model performance and Gemini search pricing alignment.\n\nAs always, the platform remains open-source. We welcome contributions or feedback on the new endpoints.",
  "reasoning": "Reddit's dev community responds best to technical specifics rather than vague hype. By framing the post around the 'Audio Stack Overhaul' and listing specific integrations (Whisper, ElevenLabs), we provide high-signal value. The 'Sound Test' visual metaphor aligns the cozy retro aesthetic with the technical subject matter."
