  "title": "Update: Added Music Generation, Whisper STT, and a Discord Bot (14 PRs merged)",
  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art dev meme infographic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Large chunky pixel headline reads 'AUDIO UPGRADE'. Bee mascot wearing big pixel headphones and holding a microphone. Three retro game UI panels displaying: 'Music Gen', 'Whisper STT', 'Discord Bot'. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Clean, readable layout for mobile. Nostalgic, nerdy, and inviting.",
  "body": "Another productive week with 14 PRs merged. We focused heavily on rounding out our audio capabilities and polishing the developer experience.\n\n**What's New:**\n\n*   **Complete Audio Suite:** We added `elevenmusic` for duration-based music generation and integrated OVH Whisper for speech-to-text transcription. We also upgraded our TTS engine to `eleven_v3` for better emotional range.\n*   **Polly Discord Bot:** A new bot to bring Pollinations' generation capabilities directly into Discord servers.\n*   **Frontend Polish:** The frontend got a significant refresh with a new header authentication flow, a theme bar, and a restyled authorization page.\n*   **Stability Fixes:** Optimized image model stability and fixed aspect ratio clamping for `klein-9b`.\n\nEverything is live now. As always, the roadmap is open and driven by the community. Let us know what you think of the new audio models.",
  "reasoning": "The title is factual and highlights the most interesting technical additions (Audio/Bot) to grab attention in a feed. The body follows the 'maintainer update' tone—concise, bulleted, and focused on what shipped without marketing fluff. The image prompt leverages the required cozy pixel art style while using the 'dev meme' format (headline + mascot + feature panels) to make the update visually digestible on Reddit."
