  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art dev meme infographic — retro audio mixer interface. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and warm cream background. Large chunky pixel headline reads 'AUDIO SUITE'. Bee mascot wearing pixel headphones adjusting sliders on a mixing board. Retro UI panels display stats: 'Whisper STT', 'Music Gen', 'TTS v3', 'Polly Bot'. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Composition: Central mixer, readable text at mobile size. Mood: Focused, chill, nerdy.",
  "body": "This week we merged 14 PRs, focusing heavily on completing the audio stack for developers.\n\n**New Audio Capabilities:**\n*   **Transcription:** Added OVH Whisper for speech-to-text.\n*   **Music Generation:** Integrated the elevenmusic model (supports duration-based billing).\n*   **TTS Upgrade:** Moved to eleven_v3 for better emotional intonation and stability.\n\n**Community Tools:**\n*   **Polly Bot:** A new Discord bot bridging our GitHub activity with the community server.\n*   **UI/UX:** Rolled out a frontend redesign for consistency and fixed aspect ratio clamping in image models.\n\nEverything is live on the repo and API. As always, feedback on the new models is welcome.",
  "reasoning": "Focuses strictly on the technical capabilities (audio stack) which is high-value for developers. The image uses the 'audio mixer' metaphor to visually represent the suite of tools while maintaining the cozy/retro brand identity."
