  "body": "Three pull requests merged today focusing on backend logic and our system bot, Polly.\n\n**The Updates:**\n\n*   **Embeddings Switch:** We moved Polly to use OpenAI embeddings. Context retrieval is significantly more accurate now, meaning fewer hallucinations when querying our documentation.\n*   **Model Routing Cleanup:** Removed old Claude fallbacks that were adding unnecessary complexity. Added explicit support for 'hidden' models and `claude-legacy` for specific use cases.\n*   **CI/CD:** Tweaked the auto-deploy pipeline to speed up iteration cycles.\n\nCode is live and open on GitHub as always. Let us know if you spot any regressions in the bot's responses.",
  "reasoning": "This post targets the engineering mindset by focusing on specific technical improvements (embeddings, removing fallbacks, CI/CD) rather than vague 'improvements.' The title is descriptive and factual, avoiding clickbait. The body explains the practical impact of the changes (better context retrieval, less complexity) which appeals to developers interested in system architecture.",
