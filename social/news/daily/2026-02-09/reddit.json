  "title": "Polly upgrades to OpenAI embeddings + flexible model routing",
  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art dev meme infographic — retro RPG skill tree screen. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Large chunky pixel headline reads 'POLLY LEVEL UP'. Retro UI panels show: 'OpenAI Embeddings', 'Legacy Models', 'Auto-Deploy'. The cute pixel art bee mascot (round chubby yellow body, brown stripes, pink blush) wears pixelated wizard glasses and casts a spell on the tree. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Readable at mobile size.",
  "body": "Just shipped 4 updates to improve our platform assistant and backend logic.\n\n**Polly (AI Assistant) Upgrade**\nWe swapped the underlying embeddings to OpenAI and overhauled the system prompt. Retrieval accuracy for documentation and code snippets should be much tighter now.\n\n**Model & Credit Logic**\n*   **Legacy Support:** Added `claude-legacy` routing and cleaned up fallback logic.\n*   **Balance Fix:** Flattened the credit deduction logic. It no longer splits costs across buckets, allowing for cleaner negative balance handling when limits are hit.\n\nDrop a comment if you notice the retrieval improvements.",
  "reasoning": "Focuses on the technical 'intelligence' upgrade (embeddings) which appeals to the dev audience. The RPG skill tree visual metaphor fits the 'level up' theme perfectly while maintaining the cozy, non-corporate brand identity."
