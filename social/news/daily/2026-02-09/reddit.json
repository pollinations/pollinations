  "title": "Update: Polly gets embeddings, simplified balance logic, and legacy model support",
  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art dev meme infographic — retro RPG character stats screen. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Large chunky pixel headline reads 'POLLY UPGRADE'. Central stats panel shows 'INT +10' and 'Memory: Embeddings'. Smaller UI boxes list: 'Single-Bucket Balance', 'Legacy Models', 'Auto-Deploy'. The main character is a cute pixel art bee mascot with a yellow body and dark brown horizontal stripes, small black legs, two black antennae, black vertical oval eyes, bright pink rectangular blush marks on cheeks, a small happy smile, and small rounded light blue translucent wings. She should be small-to-medium sized within the scene, sharing the frame with other elements — never oversized or dominating the image. Strictly pixel art style, never realistic. She wears smart wizard glasses and holds a glowing pixel orb. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Readable at mobile size. Cozy pixel art, 8-bit aesthetic, soft pastel gradients, warm lighting, retro gaming vibes.",
  "body": "Just merged a few quality-of-life updates for the platform.\n\n**Polly (our Discord bot) got a brain boost.** We swapped in OpenAI embeddings (#8111) and tweaked the system prompt (#8123). Context retrieval should be much sharper now, so she actually remembers what you're talking about.\n\n**Credit logic is cleaner.** We fixed an edge case with balance deduction (#8117). Instead of splitting costs across buckets, it's now a single-bucket deduction that allows for negative balances—much simpler for the backend to handle.\n\n**Model flexibility.** Added support for hidden models and `claude-legacy` for those who need specific older versions (#8101).\n\nAs always, the repo is open if you want to see how we implemented the embedding switch or the balance logic. Happy building.",
  "reasoning": "This post targets the technical crowd on Reddit by focusing on specific backend improvements (embeddings, balance logic) rather than vague marketing claims. The RPG 'Level Up' visual metaphor perfectly communicates the AI assistant getting smarter in a format that resonates with the gaming-adjacent dev community."
