First off, no more tab switching—we merged the Docs right into the Play page so you can build and learn in one cozy spot. 🤝\n\nPlus, the squad is growing! We added Qwen-character (for the plot) and gave Gemini a brain boost. And Polly? She’s in her independent era—hardened against leaks and thinking for herself. We love a smart queen. 💅🐝\n\nCome hang out in the garden. It’s warm here.\n\nLink in bio to play! 🌱\n\n#pollinations #opensource #pixelart #cozyvibes #indiedev #generativeai #8bit #buildinpublic #aiart #retrogaming #creativecoding",
