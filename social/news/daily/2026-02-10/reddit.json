  "title": "Merged Docs & Playground, plus security hardening updates",
  "image_prompt": "Pixel art dev meme infographic showing a retro RPG crafting station scene. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Large chunky pixel headline reads 'UNIFIED PLAYGROUND'. Central image: The Pollinations Bee mascot at a pixelated workbench combining a 'Scroll' (Docs) and a 'Game Controller' (Play). Retro UI panels floating nearby display: 'Docs + Play Merged', 'Hardened Security', 'New Models'. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Composition: Central focus, readable text at mobile size, joyful dev energy.",
  "body": "Just shipped a few updates to streamline the dev experience.\n\nMost notably, we've merged the Documentation page directly into the Playground. Context switching between reading API specs and testing endpoints is a friction point we wanted to remove, so now they live in the same interface. You can tweak params and copy code snippets without tab-switching.\n\nOther changes this week:\n*   **Security:** Hardened our system prompts to prevent leakage and enforce independent reasoning.\n*   **Models:** Added `qwen-character` and fixed executable code blocks for Gemini.\n*   **Fixes:** General stability improvements on the gateway.\n\nAs always, the repo is open if you want to see how we handled the merge or the prompt hardening.",
  "reasoning": "Focuses on a high-impact DX improvement (Unified Playground) which resonates with developers who dislike context switching. The tone is strictly informational and peer-to-peer, avoiding marketing fluff while highlighting technical improvements like security hardening."
