  "image_prompt": "[Pixel art dev meme infographic] showing system updates. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Large chunky pixel headline reads 'DOCS + PLAY MERGED'. Three retro UI panels displaying: 'Interactive API', 'New: Qwen-Character', 'Polly Hardened'. The main character is a cute pixel art bee mascot with a round chubby yellow body and dark brown horizontal stripes, small black legs, two black antennae, black vertical oval eyes, bright pink rectangular blush marks on cheeks, a small happy smile, and small rounded light blue translucent wings. She is holding a pixelated wrench near the panels. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Composition: clean hierarchy, readable at mobile size. Nostalgic but informative.",
  "body": "We just shipped a few updates to improve the developer experience on pollinations.ai.\n\n**Interactive Docs:** We merged the Documentation directly into the Play page's Integrate section. You can now test API calls and generate code snippets in the same interface without context switching.\n\n**Model Updates:** We removed the unstable flux-2-dev endpoint and added `qwen-character` for better roleplay capabilities. We also updated the gateway commits for Gemini to support executable code blocks.\n\n**Security:** Polly (our system prompt) has been hardened to better resist prompt leakage and enforce independent thinking.\n\nCode is open source as always. Let us know if the new docs flow feels faster.",
  "reasoning": "The post focuses on the Developer Experience (DX) improvement of merging docs, which is high-signal for engineers. It avoids marketing fluff and pricing discussions, sticking to factual changes (new models, security hardening). The image uses the mandatory 'cozy pixel art' style with the specific lime green hex code and bee mascot, adapted into a readable infographic format suitable for a Reddit feed."
