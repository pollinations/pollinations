  "image_prompt": "[Pixel art dev meme infographic] showing a retro RPG 'Fusion' ceremony. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Large chunky pixel headline reads 'DOCS + PLAY'. Two pixelated UI windows (one labeled 'Docs', one 'App') merging into one glowing screen. Bee mascot wearing a wizard hat casting a merge spell. Retro game text box at bottom: 'DX LEVEL UP'. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Readable at mobile size.",
  "body": "Context switching is the enemy of flow. We noticed a lot of friction moving between reading the API docs and testing prompts in the Playground, so we've merged them into a single \"Integrate\" view (#8130).\n\nAlso shipped in this batch:\n- **New Models:** Added `qwen-character` for better roleplay performance.\n- **Security:** Hardened the system prompt (Polly) against leakage and enforced strictly independent reasoning.\n- **Fixes:** Patched Gemini executable code blocks.\n\nCode is open as always. Let us know if the new UI layout helps your workflow.",
  "reasoning": "Focuses on a specific Developer Experience (DX) pain point (context switching) which resonates well with engineers. The tone is factual and highlights the 'why' behind the UI change rather than just selling it.",
