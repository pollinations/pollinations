  "image_prompt": "[Pixel art dev meme infographic] showing a retro RPG quest log screen titled 'SYSTEM UPDATE'. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Large chunky pixel headline reads 'NEW LOOT'. Three retro UI panels listing: 'Model: Qwen-Char', 'Docs in Play', 'Security Buffs'. The cute pixel art bee mascot wears a tiny pixelated knight's helmet (symbolizing security hardening) and holds a scroll. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Readable at mobile size. Cozy pixel art, 8-bit aesthetic, soft pastel gradients, warm lighting, retro gaming vibes.",
  "body": "Just merged 4 PRs for the platform. Here’s what shipped today:\n\n**Model Roster Updates**\nWe removed the unstable flux-2-dev and added qwen-character, specifically optimized for roleplay scenarios. We also updated the Airforce provider integration to reflect upstream changes.\n\n**DX Improvements**\nWe’ve merged the Documentation directly into the 'Integrate' section of the Play page. You can now read the docs and test the API endpoints in the same view without context switching.\n\n**Security Hardening**\nWe pushed fixes to harden Polly against prompt leakage and enforce independent thinking. Also patched the Gateway to better handle Gemini executable code blocks.\n\nCode is open on GitHub as always. Let us know if the new model behaves as expected.",
  "reasoning": "This post strips away all marketing fluff and focuses purely on the 'patch notes' aspect, which resonates with the Reddit developer community. The title is purely factual. The body highlights the specific technical changes (DX improvements and security patching) rather than vague benefits. The image uses a 'Quest Log' RPG metaphor to make the dry list of updates visually engaging and shareable."
