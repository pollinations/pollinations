  "alt_tweet": "why have docs in one tab and code in another?\n\nwe just merged them. docs are now live inside the play page.\n\nless tabbing, more shipping. also pushed fixes for gemini reasoning and added qwen-character.\n\nopen source & moving fast. 🐝",

  "image_prompt": "Dynamic pixel art close-up of a retro monitor screen. A UI window labeled 'DOCS' snaps into a window labeled 'PLAY', fusing into one glowing lime green (#ecf874) interface. The main character is a cute pixel art bee mascot with a round chubby yellow body and dark brown horizontal stripes, small black legs, two black antennae, black vertical oval eyes, bright pink rectangular blush marks on cheeks, a small happy smile, and small rounded light blue translucent wings. She is giving a thumbs up. High contrast, warm lighting, cozy 8-bit aesthetic, soft pastel background.",
  "reasoning": "Focuses on a tangible UX improvement (Docs integration) that developers immediately understand and value. 'Friction is the enemy' is a strong builder-centric hook. Lists technical updates (Qwen, Gemini) to show breadth of shipping without cluttering the main message.",
