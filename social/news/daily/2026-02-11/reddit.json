  "title": "Update: OpenClaw integration is live (auto-install & docs)",
  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art dev meme infographic showing a retro arcade claw machine scene. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Large chunky pixel headline reads 'OPENCLAW INTEGRATION'. The claw machine is full of pixelated 'Agent' orbs. The Pollinations Bee mascot is controlling the joystick with focus. Retro UI panels display text: 'Auto-Install', 'Setup Script', 'New Docs'. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Composition: Centralized and readable at mobile size. Mood: Playful, nerdy, productive.",
  "body": "Just merged a few PRs to streamline AI agent deployment on the platform.\n\nWe've integrated OpenClaw directly into the setup flow. The goal was to remove the friction of manual configuration when spinning up new agents.\n\n**What shipped:**\n*   **Auto-install & Onboarding:** The setup script now handles OpenClaw dependencies automatically (#8167).\n*   **Documentation:** Added a dedicated landing page and setup docs to get running faster (#8165).\n*   **UI/UX:** Aligned the branding (favicon, logos, fonts) for a consistent experience (#8168).\n\nIf you're building agents or looking for an easier way to orchestrate them, the new setup script should save you some time. As always, code is open.",
  "reasoning": "Focuses on the utility of the update (saving time/friction) rather than hype. The claw machine visual is a literal pun on 'OpenClaw' that fits the playful pixel art aesthetic perfectly while remaining informative."
