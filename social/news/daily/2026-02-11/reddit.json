  "title": "One-command setup for OpenClaw AI agents",
  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art dev meme infographic — retro arcade scene. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Large chunky pixel headline reads 'ONE-COMMAND AGENTS'. A pixel art arcade claw machine labeled 'OpenClaw' glows with lime green light. The cute pixel art bee mascot (yellow/brown stripes, pink blush, blue wings) is happily operating the joystick. The claw is lifting a glowing pixelated robot box labeled 'AUTO-INSTALL'. Retro UI panels on the side display 'Setup Script: DONE' and 'Docs: MERGED'. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Readable at mobile size. Cozy pixel art, 8-bit aesthetic, soft pastel gradients, warm lighting, retro gaming vibes.",
  "body": "We just merged full OpenClaw integration (PRs #8165, #8167). The main update is a new setup script that handles the heavy lifting—it now auto-installs OpenClaw and handles the onboarding process automatically, so you don't have to manually configure the environment. \n\nWe also cleaned up the branding assets (favicons, fonts) to ensure the interface looks consistent out of the box. If you're experimenting with autonomous agents, this should cut down the initial boilerplate significantly.",
  "reasoning": "Focuses on the 'lazy developer' benefit (one command/auto-install) which appeals to the Reddit engineering crowd. The arcade claw machine visual provides a strong, thematic visual hook that matches the 'OpenClaw' name while maintaining the cozy brand aesthetic."
