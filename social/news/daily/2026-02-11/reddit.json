  "image_prompt": "Pixel art dev meme infographic showing a retro computer terminal station. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Large chunky pixel headline reads 'OPENCLAW INTEGRATED'. A retro UI window on the screen displays 'Auto-Install: COMPLETE'. The main character is a cute pixel art bee mascot with a round chubby yellow body and dark brown horizontal stripes, small black legs, two black antennae, black vertical oval eyes, bright pink rectangular blush marks on cheeks, a small happy smile, and small rounded light blue translucent wings. She is typing happily on a mechanical keyboard. Surrounding elements: pixelated cables connecting neatly, green checkmarks floating. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Composition: Central monitor, bold text, readable on mobile. Mood: Productive and cozy.",
  "body": "Just merged a few PRs to smooth out the OpenClaw experience.\n\nPreviously, setting it up required a few manual steps. Now, the setup script handles auto-installation and onboarding automatically (#8167). We also cleaned up the branding assets (favicons, logos, fonts) to keep things consistent (#8168) and added a proper landing page (#8165).\n\nIf you're spinning up a new instance, the process should be much more \"set and forget\" now. Let me know if you hit any friction with the new script.",
  "reasoning": "This post works for Reddit because it focuses purely on the 'quality of life' improvements for developers (automation, setup scripts) rather than marketing fluff. The tone is akin to a maintainer updating a changelog. The image uses the mandatory cozy pixel aesthetic to make a dry topic (setup scripts) feel inviting and readable while highlighting the key win: integration is now complete/automated."
