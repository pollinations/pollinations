  "image_prompt": "[Pixel art dev meme infographic] showing a retro RPG 'New Skill' unlock screen. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Large chunky pixel headline reads 'OPENCLAW INTEGRATED'. Central visual: The Pollinations Bee mascot high-fiving a cute pixelated robotic claw. Retro UI panels display: 'Auto-Install: YES', 'Setup: SEAMLESS', 'Docs: UPDATED'. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Composition: Clean, centered, readable at mobile size. Mood: Joyful collaboration.",
  "body": "We've been working on reducing the friction for developers building AI agents. This week, we merged full OpenClaw integration into the Pollinations platform.\n\n**What shipped:**\n*   **Auto-configuration:** The setup script now auto-installs and onboards OpenClaw instances.\n*   **UI/UX Polish:** Fixed branding, favicons, and fonts to match the ecosystem.\n*   **Docs:** Added a dedicated landing page and setup guide.\n\nThe goal is to let you go from `git clone` to a working agent environment without fighting dependency hell. As always, the code is open source. Let us know if you hit any snags with the new setup script.",
  "reasoning": "Focuses on the 'developer experience' angle (reducing friction/dependency hell) which resonates with the Reddit engineering crowd. The image uses the 'skill unlock' gaming trope to visualize the integration fun and clearly."
