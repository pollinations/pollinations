  "image_prompt": "Cozy 8-bit pixel art scene. The main character is a cute pixel art bee mascot with a round chubby yellow body and dark brown horizontal stripes, small black legs, two black antennae, black vertical oval eyes, bright pink rectangular blush marks on cheeks, a small happy smile, and small rounded light blue translucent wings. She is standing next to a glowing retro computer terminal showing scrolling green code and a 'SYSTEM READY' status. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Emotionally warm, nostalgic but technical.",
  "reasoning": "Focuses on the 'instant' value proposition and the removal of friction ('no config hell'), which appeals to developers. Uses emojis for pacing but keeps the core message technical.",
