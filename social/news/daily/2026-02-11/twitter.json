  "image_prompt": "Dynamic pixel art arcade scene in cozy 8-bit style. The cute chubby bee mascot is skillfully operating a retro claw machine labeled 'OpenClaw'. The mechanical claw smoothly lifts a glowing lime green (#ecf874) orb. Screen displays 'AUTO-INSTALL COMPLETE' in pixel font. Warm lighting, pastel gradients, victory energy. High contrast and clean lines.",
  "reasoning": "Focuses on the technical benefit (auto-install/onboard) rather than just the feature name. Shows respect for the user's time ('removing friction'). The image puns on the 'Claw' name while maintaining the cozy brand identity.",
