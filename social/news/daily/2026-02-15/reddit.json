  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of the cute bee mascot connecting two large chunky pixel cables together to bridge a connection. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and lavender pastel gradient background. The main character is a cute pixel art bee mascot with a yellow body and dark brown horizontal stripes, small black legs, two black antennae, black vertical oval eyes, bright pink rectangular blush marks on cheeks, a small happy smile, and small rounded light blue translucent wings. She is wearing a tiny pixelated engineer's hard hat. Floating retro UI windows show green connection status bars. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley or A Short Hike. Text in pixel font: 'API READY'. Nostalgic but beautiful, emotionally warm. Cozy pixel art, 8-bit aesthetic, soft pastel gradients, warm lighting, retro gaming vibes.",
  "body": "We just merged support for an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint (#8234). This allows developers to use existing client libraries with Pollinations just by changing the base URL—making it easier to test models without rewriting integration code.\n\nThe App Showcase also got a UI refresh (#8248) to better display metrics and descriptions for community-built tools. On the model side, we integrated Qwen3Guard 8B (#8279) for improved safety filtering and fixed aspect ratio conversion for Grok generations (#8258).\n\nCode and roadmap are open as always. Feedback on the new endpoint is welcome.",
  "reasoning": "The OpenAI-compatible endpoint is a high-value technical update that reduces friction for developers, making it the strongest hook for a dev-focused subreddit. The tone remains objective and focuses on utility (ease of testing) rather than hype.",
