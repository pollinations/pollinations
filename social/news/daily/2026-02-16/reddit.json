  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of the cute bee mascot pinning a shiny golden pixel badge onto a large lime green (#ecf874) flower. The bee wears a tiny tool belt. Soft pastel gradient background (mint to peach). Floating pixel icons of a film strip (video) and a character portrait (persona) surround the flower. Warm lighting, lo-fi aesthetic like Stardew Valley. Text in chunky pixel font: 'POLLEN BADGES'. The main character is a cute pixel art bee mascot with a yellow body and dark brown horizontal stripes, small black legs, two black antennae, black vertical oval eyes, bright pink rectangular blush marks on cheeks, a small happy smile, and small rounded light blue translucent wings. Cozy pixel art, 8-bit aesthetic, soft pastel gradients, warm lighting, retro gaming vibes.",
  "body": "We just merged 20 PRs focusing on ecosystem visibility and creative tooling.\n\n**Pollen Badges & Rebrand**\nWe've transitioned \"BYOP\" (Bring Your Own Pollen) into a unified \"Pollen\" identity. The new badge system is now live on the apps page, making contribution tiers (Spore, Seed, Flower, Nectar) visible directly on app cards. This improves transparency for how maintainers and contributors are recognized within the ecosystem.\n\n**Creative Toolkit Expansion**\nThree notable additions to the Creative suite:\n* **P2S (Video Consistency):** Added to improve temporal stability in AI video generation.\n* **Personic:** A new tool specifically for consistent character design and persona generation.\n* **Sticker Garden:** A dedicated generator for pixel-perfect sticker assets.\n\n**Dev & Utility**\nFor developers, we added an AI Router to Dev_Tools and the OpenCode Pollinations Plugin to streamline integration. We also restored visibility logic for the apps page to ensure new submissions appear correctly.\n\nThe roadmap remains open.",
  "reasoning": "This post highlights the structural change to the credit system ('Pollen') which is central to the community model, while listing specific, usable tools for creators to drive immediate engagement. The tone remains factual and update-centric.",
