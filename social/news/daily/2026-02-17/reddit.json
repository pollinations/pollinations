  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of the cute bee mascot (Polly) wearing a tiny painter's beret, painting a long scrolling canvas that extends off-screen. A chunky robot with a monitor head is holding the other end of the canvas. The canvas shows a pixelated landscape. Background is a soft lime green (#ecf874) and lavender gradient. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Text in pixel font at the top: 'SLIDE PAINTER'. Cozy pixel art, 8-bit aesthetic, chunky sprites, soft atmosphere.",
  "body": "Merged 5 PRs today. \n\n`SlidePainter` is live (#8341) — it's a simple tool for generating scrolling/panning images. \n\nFixed a deployment pipeline issue where custom domains were targeting `main` instead of `production` (#8343). \n\nWe also added a step to prettify app descriptions with markdown (#8334). Naturally, the LLM immediately started hallucinating creative new names for existing apps, so we pushed a fix to stop that (#8362). \n\nUI got a small touch-up: logo cycles themes now and tooltips have better contrast. \n\nRepo here: https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations",
  "reasoning": "Title is purely factual. Body highlights the humor in the LLM hallucination bug (relatable to devs) and explains the infra fix clearly. Image focuses on the new feature (SlidePainter) while keeping the cozy/maintainer vibe.",
