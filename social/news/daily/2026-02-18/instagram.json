  "caption": "Five PRs merged this week. We added a Build Diary to the community page so you can see the history of what's being made. It's like a guestbook, but for code.\n\nAlso did some plumbing: upstream 429s now map correctly to 502s, and we're actually extracting error messages from JSON now instead of just guessing. Nomnom is pleased.\n\nFinally, added a dashboard to simulate tier costs because math is hard and visualizers are nice.\n\nCheck the repo for the details.\n\n#pollinations #opensource #buildinpublic #pixelart #indiedev #creativecoding #aitools #devlog",
