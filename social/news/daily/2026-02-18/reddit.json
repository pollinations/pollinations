  "body": "Merged 5 PRs today. The Build Diary on the community page is now interactive. We wanted a way to visualize the \"hive\" activity without the usual sterile status page vibe, so you can now actually scroll through what's being built in real-time.\n\nBackend focus was cleaning up error handling. We were previously passing upstream 429s (Too Many Requests) directly to clients. This was confusing because it looked like users were hitting their own rate limits when it was actually the upstream providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) under load. We remapped those to 502s to clearly distinguish infrastructure pressure from user quotas. We also added logic to extract and pass through the actual JSON error messages from upstream rather than just the status code, which makes debugging failed generations significantly less of a guessing game.\n\nOn the logic side, the Seed tier (credits for contributors) now calculates based on a 90-day commit window to keep the signal fresh. Also added a cost simulation dashboard to help us model sustainability without relying on back-of-napkin math.\n\nRepo: https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations\nCommunity: https://pollinations.ai/community",
  "reasoning": "Title focuses on technical deliverables rather than hype. Body explains the 'why' behind the HTTP status code changes—a specific technical detail that developers appreciate—and avoids marketing fluff. Tone is dry and observational.",
