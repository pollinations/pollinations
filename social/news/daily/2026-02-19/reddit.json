  "body": "We merged six PRs today. The most significant technical debt payment was a comprehensive rename and cleanup of the SDK and MCP packages (#8421). The package structure was accumulating cruft, so we standardized the naming and stripped out unused dependencies. If you're building with the python client, the import paths are cleaner now.\n\nThe more experimental update is #7920, which we're calling \"Auto-Polly.\" It's an initial implementation of an AI agent designed to identify and attempt fixes for platform bugs automatically. It monitors error logs and proposes code patches. It's not fully autonomous yet—we still review the PRs—but it's starting to handle the low-hanging fruit.\n\nDocumentation also got a pass. We streamlined the onboarding process (#7939) to reduce friction for new contributors. We also explicitly documented the video duration parameters (#8364) and improved the API error response guides (#7942). Debugging auth issues or parameter mismatches should be less of a guessing game now.\n\nEverything is live. Code is on GitHub.",
  "reasoning": "Title is purely factual and highlights the most interesting engineering challenge (self-fixing code). Body focuses on the 'what' and 'why' of the changes without marketing fluff. Image visualizes the 'auto-fix' concept using the required character set and color palette.",
