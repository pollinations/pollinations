  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of the cute bee mascot (Polly) and the chunky monitor-head robot in a digital workshop. The robot is proudly holding a new pixelated tool module labeled 'GX'. Polly is observing with a clipboard. The main character is a cute pixel art bee mascot with a yellow body and dark brown horizontal stripes, small black legs, two black antennae, black vertical oval eyes, bright pink rectangular blush marks on cheeks, a small happy smile, and small rounded light blue translucent wings. Background is a soft gradient of lime green (#ecf874) and pastel lavender. Warm lighting, lo-fi 8-bit aesthetic, Stardew Valley vibes. Text in pixel font: 'NEW INTEGRATION'. Cozy pixel art, 8-bit aesthetic, soft pastel gradients, warm lighting, retro gaming vibes.",
  "body": "Slow day on the repo, just one PR merged today (#7236). We've added Genexus AI support to the dev tools package.\n\nFor those not familiar, Genexus is heavy on the enterprise/low-code side. While that's usually the antithesis of the hacker vibe we usually go for, the goal of pollinations is open infrastructure for *everyone*—even if your IDE wears a tie. If it speaks HTTP, we want to support it.\n\nThis integration means you can now pipe prompts and generation requests from Genexus environments directly through our standard text endpoints. It handles the handshake and format conversion so you don't have to write custom middleware or deal with nuanced API quirks manually. It abstracts the complexity so you can just send text and get text.\n\nIt's live now. If you break it, open an issue. If you want to add support for your own preferred stack—whether it's obscure, enterprise, or something you built last weekend—the repo is open and we merge pretty fast.\n\n[Link to GitHub]\n[Link to Docs]",
  "reasoning": "Acknowledges the small update volume honestly ('Slow day'). Uses the 'IDE wears a tie' joke to maintain the anti-corporate persona while justifying an enterprise feature. Keeps it technical and focused on the 'infrastructure for everyone' mission.",
