    "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of the Pollinations bee carefully tending to a special garden section with glowing rare crystal flowers. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Bee character with chunky retro sprites moving a cloud-shaped plant to a new pot. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley or A Short Hike. Nostalgic but beautiful, emotionally warm."
