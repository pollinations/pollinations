    "visual_concept": "The pollinations.ai bee mascot in a cozy pixel art observatory or shop, updating a price tag on a glowing telescope or crystal ball. The telescope represents the 'search' capability (looking for answers). The price tag update represents the cost reduction. The 'Flash' aspect can be hinted at with a lightning bolt motif on the telescope.",
    "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of the 8-bit bee mascot adjusting a price tag on a glowing digital telescope. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and lavender gradient background. Chunky retro sprites, warm lighting. The telescope points to a constellation shaped like a twin star. Pixel text on tag: 'SALE'. Lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Nostalgic but beautiful."
