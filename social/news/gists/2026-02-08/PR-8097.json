    "visual_concept": "The pollinations.ai bee as a tiny engineer in a cozy server room, tuning three distinct retro-futuristic machines (representing the three models). One machine (Flux) is being stabilized, another (Sana) is being polished to shine brighter, and the third (Twinflow) is being streamlined for speed.",
    "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of the pollinations.ai bee wearing a tiny engineer cap, fine-tuning three glowing retro server racks. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Chunky retro sprites, warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley or A Short Hike. Pixel text 'SYSTEM OPTIMIZED' on a screen. Nostalgic but beautiful, emotionally warm."
