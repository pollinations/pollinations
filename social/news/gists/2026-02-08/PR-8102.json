    "visual_concept": "The concept focuses on unification and simplicity. Instead of juggling multiple piles of resources (tier vs pack), the bee is happily holding one consolidated treasure. The retro game UI element reinforces this with a clean, single score counter.",
    "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of the bee mascot holding a single, glowing golden pollen orb. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. A retro game UI overlay shows a simple 'BALANCE: 100' counter. Chunky pixels, warm lighting, lo-fi aesthetic. Nostalgic but beautiful."
