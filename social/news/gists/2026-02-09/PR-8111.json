    "summary": "Polly upgrades to OpenAI's `text-embedding-small` model and implements hash-based diffing for efficient indexing.",
    "impact": "Users will experience more accurate document retrieval and faster processing times due to reduced compute load.",

    "visual_concept": "Polly (likely a parrot mascot given the name) interacting with 'smart' glowing books or data. The change is about embeddings (understanding text better) and optimization. A pixel art parrot organizing a glowing library represents this well.",
    "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of a cute 8-bit parrot character organizing glowing magical books on a library shelf. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and lavender gradient background. The pollinations.ai bee is holding a tiny lantern nearby to help. Chunky retro sprites, warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Nostalgic but beautiful, emotionally warm."
