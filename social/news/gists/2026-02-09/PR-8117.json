    "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of the Pollinations bee organizing three distinct wooden buckets of glowing pollen. The bee is carefully taking from just one bucket, keeping the others neat. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel lavender gradient background. Chunky retro sprites, warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Text 'Tidy Credits' in pixel font. Nostalgic but beautiful, emotionally warm."
