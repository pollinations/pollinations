    "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of the 8-bit bee mascot standing behind a wooden counter, scooping glowing honey from a single large jar. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel peach gradient background. Cute bee character with chunky retro sprites. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Pixel text on jar: 'POLLEN'. Nostalgic but beautiful, emotionally warm."
