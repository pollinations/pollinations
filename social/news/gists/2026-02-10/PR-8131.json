    "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of the Pollinations bee watching a friendly robot wizard assembling glowing code blocks that form a path. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel violet gradient background. Chunky retro sprites, warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley or A Short Hike. Pixel thought bubbles with logic symbols. Nostalgic but beautiful, emotionally warm."
