    "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of the Pollinations bee artist adding finishing touches to a pixelated 'OpenClaw' signboard. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel peach gradient background. The bee holds a tiny pixel brush with chunky retro sprites. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley or A Short Hike. Nostalgic but beautiful, emotionally warm."
