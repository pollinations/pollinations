    "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of the cute bee mascot wearing tiny reading glasses, holding a large open book that glows with lime green (#ecf874) magic. Tiny pixel characters and story elements float out of the pages. Soft pastel gradient background, warm library atmosphere, lo-fi aesthetic like Stardew Valley. Nostalgic and creative."
