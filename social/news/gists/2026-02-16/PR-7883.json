The vibe is studious but relaxed, emphasizing the 'free' and 'easy' nature of the tool compared to stressful paid exams.",
    "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of the cute bee mascot wearing a tiny graduation cap and holding a pixel pencil next to a large A+ exam paper. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Chunky retro sprites. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Nostalgic but beautiful, emotionally warm."
