The Pollinations bee mascot is watering them with a pixelated watering can. The vibe is growth and celebration.",
    "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of the cute bee mascot watering six unique, colorful magical flowers sprouting in a digital garden. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. The bee has a yellow body, dark stripes, pink blush, and wears a tiny gardener's hat. Chunky retro sprites. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley or A Short Hike. Text in pixel font: 'NEW APPS'. Nostalgic but beautiful, emotionally warm."
