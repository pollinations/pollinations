    "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of the cute bee mascot wearing a tiny security cap, sorting pixelated data scrolls into a glowing green bin labeled 'MAIN'. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and lavender gradient background. Chunky retro sprites, warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Text in pixel font: 'CLEAN CI'. Nostalgic but beautiful, emotionally warm."
