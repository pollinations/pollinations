    "visual_concept": "The Pollinations bee as a movie director. Key symbols: film strips, director's megaphone, clapperboard. The concept highlights 'consistency' by showing the bee looking at a film strip where the frames match perfectly.",
    "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of the cute bee mascot wearing a tiny director's beret and holding a megaphone. She is examining a glowing film strip where every frame is perfect. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel peach gradient background. Chunky retro sprites, warm lighting, lo-fi aesthetic like Stardew Valley. Text in pixel font: 'ACTION'. Nostalgic but beautiful, emotionally warm."
