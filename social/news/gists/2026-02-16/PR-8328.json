Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. The bee wears a tiny artist beret and is surrounded by sheets of colorful stickers with white borders. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley or A Short Hike. Text in pixel font: 'STICKER GARDEN'. Nostalgic but beautiful, emotionally warm."
