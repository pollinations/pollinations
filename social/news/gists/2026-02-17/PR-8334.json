The text on the panel is transforming from plain gray lines into colorful bold headers and bullet points. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and lavender gradient background. Chunky retro sprites, warm lighting, lo-fi aesthetic like Stardew Valley. Text in pixel font: 'MARKDOWN'. Cozy pixel art, 8-bit aesthetic, soft pastel gradients, warm lighting, retro gaming vibes."
