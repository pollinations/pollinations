    "visual_concept": "The robot (representing the AI) is enthusiastically mislabeling things with exciting names like 'Chaos Commander', while the Bee (the maintainer) follows behind with a clipboard and a label maker, correcting them back to their boring real names.",
    "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of the cute bee mascot helping a chunky robot organize a shelf of software boxes. The robot holds a box labeled 'CHAOS COMMANDER', but the bee is correcting it with a label gun. Lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Pixel font text on boxes. Nostalgic but beautiful."
