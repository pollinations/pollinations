    "visual_concept": "The concept is 'clarity from chaos'. The Robot (who usually sees things) is holding a printout that was previously static/garbled, but now shows clear text. The Bee is helping adjust the antenna/signal.",
    "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of the cute robot with a monitor head holding a data printout that clearly reads 'OOPS'. The bee mascot hovers nearby adjusting a lime green (#ecf874) antenna to clear the signal. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Cute robot and bee with chunky retro sprites. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley or A Short Hike. Text in pixel font: 'OOPS'. Nostalgic but beautiful, emotionally warm."
