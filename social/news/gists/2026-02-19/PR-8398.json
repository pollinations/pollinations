A robot companion checks a clipboard. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel peach gradient background. The bee and robot have chunky retro sprites. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Pixel text: 'ACCESS GRANTED'. Nostalgic but beautiful, emotionally warm."
