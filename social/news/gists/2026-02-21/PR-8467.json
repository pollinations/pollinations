She is unpacking digital boxes in a new room. A chunky robot helper sets up a retro terminal glowing lime green (#ecf874). Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. The bee wears a tiny tool belt. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley or A Short Hike. Pixel text: 'POLLY SOURCE'. Nostalgic but beautiful, emotionally warm."
