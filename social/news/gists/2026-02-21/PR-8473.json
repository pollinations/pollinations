    "blurb": "Our bot was trying to ingest the entire codebase in a single gulp. We've introduced batching so she can digest data without getting a token-overflow tummy ache.",
    "summary": "Implemented request batching for code embeddings to prevent API token limits and fixed logic to ensure knowledge updates on restart.",
    "impact": "The Polly bot is now more reliable at indexing documentation and code, resulting in fewer errors and fresher answers.",

    "visual_concept": "Polly the bee as a librarian or student, dealing with too many books/scrolls. The fix is 'batching', so she is organizing a messy pile into neat, manageable stacks. The setting should be a cozy study or library.",
    "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of the cute bee mascot sitting at a wooden desk, sorting a large messy pile of code scrolls into small neat stacks. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. The bee wears tiny reading glasses. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Nostalgic but beautiful, emotionally warm."
