    "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of the cute bee mascot wearing a tiny headset, sitting at a creator's desk. A retro monitor displays a pixelated 'Play' button and rising graph lines. Lime green (#ecf874) and soft peach gradient background. Chunky pixels, warm lighting, lo-fi aesthetic like Stardew Valley. Text in pixel font: 'ON AIR'. Nostalgic but beautiful."
