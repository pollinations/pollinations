Now tracking Tier Balance (daily reset) and Pack Balance separately. It’s like having distinct Health and Mana bars now.\n\n🌱 **The Magic Number:** Fixed the docs—Seed 42 is officially the answer to life, the universe, and reproducible images (sorry -1).\n\n🔭 **Better Views:** Added a 60-minute window to the Model Monitor for a more stable look at the horizon.\n\nPlus, faster syncs and smoother app submissions. Coding should feel like a warm hug, not a battle. 🫂\n\nLink in bio to read the changelog! 🔗\n\n#pollinations #opensource #pixelart #indiedev #cozyweb #generativeai #8bit #retrogaming #buildinpublic",
