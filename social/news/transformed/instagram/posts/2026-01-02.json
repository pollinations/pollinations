Send images and let the AI analyze them. \n\n🇸🇪 **Hej Sweden:** We moved our GPT-5.2 endpoint to Sweden Central. Better vibes, no content blocks on the 'openai-large' model. \n\n🧹 **Spring Cleaning:** We tidied up the API keys table (no more weird scrolling!) and squashed some bugs in the tier workflows. \n\nEverything is looking cozy and pixel-perfect. Try it out! \n\nLink in bio to build 🌿\n\n#pollinations #aiart #opensource #pixelart #retrogaming #indiedev #8bit #cozyvibes #genzdev",
