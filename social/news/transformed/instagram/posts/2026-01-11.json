Legit Spore users now get automatically promoted to Seed tier (that means daily credits! 🍯).\n\nPlus, we did some spring cleaning with our code helper (thanks Claude! 🤖) to make app reviews smoother and faster. Less bugs, more flowers.\n\nBuild something beautiful today. Link in bio to start generating! 🌸\n\n#pollinations #opensource #pixelart #indiedev #cozyvibes #aiart #genztech #buildinpublic",
