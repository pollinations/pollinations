The menu shows a pixelated graph titled 'Daily Spending' drawn in lime green (#ecf874) on parchment. To the side, a cute 8-bit bee mascot is holding a quill, looking organized. Soft afternoon sunlight filters through leaves, casting dappled shadows on the desk. Warm, nostalgic atmosphere like the menu screen of a wholesome indie game. Chunky pixels, soft pastel details.",

Warm, amber lighting with soft shadows. Represents the Polly system prompt improvements and OpenAI embeddings. Cozy, studious vibes like Stardew Valley library.",

Previously there were many small cups, now just one sturdy bucket. The 8-bit bee mascot is happily sitting on the rim of the bucket. Soft pastel garden background with pixel flowers blooming. Represents the 'single-bucket balance deduction' fix. Wholesome, clean, low-res aesthetic with modern lighting effects.",
