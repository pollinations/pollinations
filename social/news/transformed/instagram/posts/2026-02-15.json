  "caption": "dev logs but make it cozy 🍵✨\n\nwe’ve been doing some spring cleaning in the code garden. here’s what’s blooming:\n\n🗺️ **OpenClaw for Everyone:** We took OpenClaw from \"hackathon secret\" to \"everyone's guide.\" The docs are now generalized so you can build cooler stuff easier.\n\n📺 **Video Level Up:** Enabled image-to-video for Grok (remix your pics!) + added Alibaba fallback for Wan video models. Meaning: your video generations are more stable than my sleep schedule.\n\n🎨 **Polishing Pixels:** Fixed up the edit modes for GPTimage. No more glitches in the matrix.\n\ngrab a tea and come build with us. link in bio 🌸\n\n#pollinations #opensource #pixelart #cozyvibes #indiedev #buildinpublic #8bitart #generativeai",
