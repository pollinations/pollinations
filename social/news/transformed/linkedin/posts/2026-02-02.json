Here is what our team shipped in 43 merged PRs this week:\n\n🛠️ **Infrastructure & Hardware**\nWe added specific documentation for deploying our image generation stack on the new RTX 5090 instances. If you are looking to run high-end models like Flux or TwinFlow on the latest architecture, the path is now clear.\n\n🧹 **Architecture Refactor**\nWe removed the model caching layer entirely from our MCP (Model Context Protocol) implementation. Sometimes the best code is deleted code. By fetching models directly from the API, we eliminated state synchronization issues and reduced complexity.\n\n🔒 **Security & Ops**\nHardened our cron jobs with separate authentication tokens for tier refills and prepared our codebase for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) contributors.\n\nOpen source moves fast. We're just trying to keep the documentation moving faster.",

    "prompt": "A professional pixel art infographic card for a tech update. Large, chunky pixel headline at the top reads 'WEEKLY SHIP: 43 PRs'. Below, a visual breakdown in a grid layout: Left side shows a detailed pixel art GPU icon labeled 'RTX 5090 READY'. Right side shows a broom icon labeled 'CACHE REMOVED'. Bottom section has a 'Security Hardened' badge. A cute pixel bee mascot in the corner is wearing a hard hat and holding a blueprint. Style: clean isometric pixel art, reminiscent of SimCity 2000 but modern. Color palette: Dominant lime green (#ecf874) background sections, cream white panels, dark navy text. Composition: Organized, infographic style, high legibility. Text must be: crisp, bold pixel font, no distortion.",

  },
  "reasoning": "The mention of RTX 5090 is a major engagement hook for the tech/AI audience on LinkedIn, as access to and performance of these cards is a trending topic. Combining this with 'deleting code' (cache removal) signals engineering maturity. The image uses the infographic style to convey velocity (43 PRs) and the headline feature (5090) at a glance.",
