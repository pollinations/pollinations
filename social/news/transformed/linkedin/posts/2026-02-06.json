These models require significant compute, and aligning their cost with our 'Flower' and 'Nectar' tiers ensures we can maintain high availability.\n\n2. **Keeping Creativity Free**\nCrucially, `gemini-fast` remains completely free. We are committed to ensuring that students, tinkerers, and first-time coders always have a powerful engine to build on, zero credit card required.\n\n3. **Hardening the Infrastructure**\nBeyond the business logic, the engineering team shipped **20 merged PRs** this week focused on reliability at scale:\n\n• **Rate Limit Handling:** We patched a critical bottleneck in our 'Spore-to-Seed' upgrade path, handling GitHub's 403/429 rate limits more gracefully. As the community grows, these 'invisible' backend fixes are what keep the experience smooth.\n• **Dashboard Polish:** A major refactor of the API key management UI and Azure resource consolidation means a cleaner, faster experience for developers managing their budgets.\n\nWe aren't just building a wrapper; we are building a permanent home for open-source AI creativity. This week was about reinforcing the foundation.\n\nAre you building on the free tier or scaling with pro? Let us know below.",

  "reasoning": "This post addresses the 'Paid Models' update head-on, framing it as a maturity/sustainability move rather than a restriction. This signals to investors that the business model is solidifying. Highlighting the 20 PRs and technical fixes (rate limits) reassures developers that the platform is robust and actively maintained.",
