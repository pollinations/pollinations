  "body": "Security and autonomy are the difference between a toy and a tool. This week, we hardened our core agent logic to prevent prompt leakage vulnerabilities. Instead of just executing instructions, the system now evaluates context—making it more robust for real-world applications.\n\nBut that's just one piece of the momentum.\n\nWe merged **59 PRs** this week. The focus wasn't just on code, but on expanding the ecosystem for everyone building on Pollinations:\n\n🔹 **Ecosystem Growth:** welcomed Sage (Social_Bots) and Korpi.AI (Creative) to our app directory. Seeing developers ship finished products on our infrastructure is the ultimate validation.\n\n🔹 **DevOps Maturity:** shipped a new auto-deploy script for the Polly bot. This reduces friction in our CI/CD pipeline, meaning faster iterations and less downtime for users.\n\n🔹 **Stability:** Patched critical bugs in our tier-cost logic and optimized gateway commits for Gemini integration.\n\nWe are building the open-source standard for AI creativity. It's not just about generating images; it's about providing the robust, secure infrastructure that lets 500+ other apps run their businesses.\n\nNo black boxes. No gatekeeping. Just shipping.\n\nCheck the changelog or start building.",
