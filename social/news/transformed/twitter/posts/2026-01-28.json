    "prompt": "An energetic pixel art scene depicting a 'Level Up' moment for a cute AI mascot character. The character, a small glowing robot bee, is hovering in the center, radiating waves of power in lime green (#ecf874) and electric blue. Above it, a floating pixelated banner reads 'UPGRADE COMPLETE'. Background is a dark, cozy coding environment with floating 400 and 200 status codes turning into confetti. Style: 16-bit SNES RPG evolution screen meets high-contrast cyberpunk. Composition: Centered, explosive energy, scroll-stopping neon colors. Avoid: Dull colors, corporate minimalism, realistic style."

  "reasoning": "Combines the major feature release (Kimi K2.5) with a relatable dev-humor bug fix (400 vs 500 errors). The 'Level Up' visual reinforces the model upgrade, while the text keeps it casual and community-focused.",
