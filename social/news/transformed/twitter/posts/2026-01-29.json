    "prompt": "A humorous split-screen pixel art meme showing a developer bee's journey. Left panel ('Before'): A chaotic server room with red warning lights, smoke, and 'OOM ERROR' text bubbles floating around a panicked pixel bee. Right panel ('After'): The same room now chill and glowing with soft blue light, the pixel bee wearing sunglasses and relaxing in a lime green (#ecf874) beanbag chair, watching a holographic dashboard with stable graphs. Style: 8-bit retro gaming aesthetic, expressive and cute. Composition: distinct contrast between chaos and zen. Avoid: realistic style, corporate stock art vibes."

  "reasoning": "Highlights the critical stability fix (OOM errors) which is a major pain point for AI devs, while mentioning the new dashboard feature. The tone is relaxed and self-assured ('we're back'), using the relatable 'pov' format and emoji usage to fit the dev-twitter persona.",
