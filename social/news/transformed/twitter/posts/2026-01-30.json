    "prompt": "A triumphant pixel art scene featuring a developer bee character holding a tiny, glowing banana aloft like a legendary RPG item. The bee has a proud, determined expression, wearing oversized dev glasses. In the background, a retro computer terminal displays 'MODEL: NANOBANANA' in chunky lime green (#ecf874) text. To the side, a dusty file folder labeled 'Nix' is floating into a pixelated trash bin. Style: energetic 8-bit aesthetic, high contrast electric purple shadows, vibrant and joyful. Composition: centered hero shot, dynamic action pose, scroll-stopping color pop. Avoid: blurry details, realistic textures, corporate boredom."
  },
  "reasoning": "Highlights the funniest update ('nanobanana') while celebrating the technical cleanup (removing Nix). The tone is casual, uses the bee/nature branding, and fits the 'devs having fun' persona.",
