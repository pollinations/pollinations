    "prompt": "A narrative pixel art scene at an exclusive nightclub entrance at night. Foreground: A cool pixel bee bouncer in a tuxedo and sunglasses holding a velvet rope, checking a 'PAID' ID card. Background: Through the open door, a vibrant party with glowing text entities 'CLAUDE' and 'VEO' dancing under lime green #ecf874 disco lights. To the side: a translucent, ghostly 'TURBO' model floating away into the starry night sky, looking nostalgic. Style: Cyberpunk pixel art meets cozy Stardew Valley vibes. Atmosphere: Exclusive, energetic, neon-soaked. Avoid: scary vibes, realistic rendering, messy composition."

  "reasoning": "Highlights the biggest user-facing change (paid gating) with a 'VIP' metaphor that translates well to a fun image. Acknowledges the removal of Turbo and the security updates without getting bogged down in technical jargon. Uses the 'we are so back' energy consistent with the persona.",
