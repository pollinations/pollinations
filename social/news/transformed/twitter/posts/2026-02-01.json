    "prompt": "A vibrant, satisfying pixel art scene of a digital 'refill station'. A massive, futuristic dispenser labeled 'GH ACTIONS' is pouring glowing lime green (#ecf874) and honey-gold liquid into pixelated jars held by eager little bees. The liquid glows with magical energy. The scene feels like a 'level up' moment in a retro RPG. Text 'REFILL SECURED' floats in the air in bold pixel font. Style: crisp 16-bit aesthetic, high contrast, joyful energy. Avoid: blurry details, dull colors, corporate vectors."

  "reasoning": "Focuses on the technical backend update (Cloudflare -> GH Actions) but frames it in user-centric benefits (reliable credits/pollen). Uses the 'pollen must flow' Dune reference which resonates with dev/sci-fi culture. The tone is casual and slightly cheeky.",
