    "prompt": "A dynamic pixel art scene showing a tiny, proud bee developer standing next to a MASSIVE, towering RTX 5090 graphics card. The GPU is glowing with intense lime green (#ecf874) energy and electric sparks, looking like a monolith of power. The bee is wearing cool pixel shades and holding a wrench. Background is a cozy dark coding environment with floating documentation pages turning into sparkles. Style: high-contrast 8-bit aesthetic, vibrant and energetic. Composition: low angle looking up at the GPU to emphasize scale. Avoid: realistic hardware rendering, boring white background."

  "reasoning": "Highlights the most exciting hardware update (RTX 5090) which appeals to the power-user/dev demographic, while mentioning the technical 'cache removal' update as a 'freshness' benefit. The tone is confident ('we are so back') and uses the hardware flex to drive engagement.",
