    "prompt": "A cozy yet high-stakes pixel art scene. Center stage: a cute bee developer sweating nervously but looking relieved, hand hovering over a massive, glowing industrial toggle switch labeled 'API BUDGET'. The switch is firmly set to 'SAFE MODE' in electric lime green (#ecf874). Background shows a holographic dashboard where a red 'spending' line was skyrocketing but has now flatlined safely. Style: detailed 8-bit aesthetic like a sci-fi indie game UI. Lighting: dramatic monitor glow against deep purple shadows. Composition: close-up focus on the satisfying click of the switch to emphasize control. Avoid: realistic hands, boring spreadsheets, corporate minimalism."

  "reasoning": "Focuses on the most relatable 'pain point' feature (budget control/safety) which drives engagement from devs who fear unexpected bills. Mentions the GPT-5.2 upgrade to show technical progress. Uses the 'ship ship ship' mantra to maintain momentum.",
