  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of the cute chubby bee mascot in a retro recording studio, wearing headphones and adjusting sliders on a mixing board. Background features pixelated screens showing colorful video loops. Text 'Weekly Wrap' in chunky pixel font floating at the top. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel lavender gradient background. Warm lighting, lo-fi aesthetic, like Stardew Valley meets a music studio. Nostalgic, celebratory, high quality 8-bit art.",
  "reasoning": "This update is heavy on multi-modal features (audio/video), so the message groups these effectively to show the expanded creative range. The tone is enthusiastic and highlights the 'Sonic Boom' and visual upgrades. The image prompt reflects the audio/studio theme while maintaining the mandatory cozy pixel art style and brand colors.",
