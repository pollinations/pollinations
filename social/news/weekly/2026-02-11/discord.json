  "message": "Hey <@&1424461167883194418>! Grab your keyboards, it's time to build. 🐝✨\n\n## 🌸 Weekly Update - 2026-02-11\n\nThis week wasn't just an update; it was a total **level up**. We've overhauled the look, packed the library with powerful new models, and gave the platform a fresh voice. Here is what you can play with right now:\n\n🎥 **Visuals & Video**\n- **LTX-2 Video Model** is here! Create stunning AI video content directly in your apps.\n- **Imagen 3 & Grok Imagine Video** joined the party via api.airforce. More choices = better art.\n- **Frontend Glow-Up**: We redesigned the UI to be cleaner, faster, and cozier. The **Docs** are now merged right into the **Play** page, so you can learn while you build without tab-switching madness.\n\n🎵 **Audio & Speech**\n- **ElevenMusic**: Drop the beat with duration-based music generation.\n- **OVH Whisper**: High-accuracy speech-to-text transcription is now live.\n- **Polly Discord Bot**: A new friend in the server to help out.\n\n🧠 **Brains & Characters**\n- **Claude Opus 4.6**: Smarter, faster, stronger.\n- **Qwen Character**: A new model specifically tuned for roleplay and character interactions.\n- (We also said goodbye to the unstable `flux-2-dev` to keep things smooth).\n\nWe also smoothed out the onboarding with auto-install scripts for OpenClaw. It’s never been easier to go from \"zero\" to \"deployed\".\n\nGo break things (in a good way)! 🌸\n\n**Stay playful.**",
  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of the pollinations.ai bee mascot sitting at a futuristic but retro 8-bit control station. The screens are glowing with lime green (#ecf874) and soft pastels, showing video clips and music waves. Floating pixel icons represent 'Video', 'Music', and 'Art'. Warm lighting, lo-fi aesthetic like Stardew Valley. Text in pixel font: 'LEVEL UP'. Nostalgic, celebratory, and inviting.",
  "reasoning": "This update highlights a massive influx of creative tools (video, music, speech) and a major UI overhaul, fitting the 'level up' theme perfectly for a builder community.",
