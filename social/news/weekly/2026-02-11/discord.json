Grab your headphones and popcorn — this week was all about turning up the volume and setting things in motion. 🐝\n\n**🎥 Next-Gen Video & Imaging**\nWe just dropped a massive payload of creative power. **LTX-2** and **Grok-Video** are live for generation, plus **Imagen-4** and **Flux-2-dev** for top-tier static visuals. If you can dream it, we can render it.\n\n**🔊 The Audio Revolution**\nMake some noise with the new **ElevenMusic** model (now with smarter duration-based billing) and **OVH Whisper** for crisp speech-to-text transcription. Your apps can now hear and sing.\n\n**🤖 Agents & Open Source**\nFor the builders: **OpenClaw** integration is officially here with a dedicated setup page. We also open-sourced the **Polly Discord Bot** — go fork it, mod it, and build your own community agents.\n\n**✨ Smooth Sailing**\nWe've merged **Docs** directly into the **Play Page** (no more tab switching!), redesigned the frontend for better audio support, and upgraded Claude to **Opus 4.6**. \n\nGo build something loud! 🌸",
  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of the cute chubby bee mascot in a retro creative studio. The bee is wearing pixelated headphones and holding a tiny movie clapperboard. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and lavender pastel gradient background. Floating pixel icons of musical notes, film reels, and a robot claw. Large chunky pixel text at the top reads 'THE BUZZ'. Warm lighting, lo-fi aesthetic like Stardew Valley. 16-bit SNES pixel art, Stardew Valley style, chunky sprites, visible pixels, soft pastel gradients, warm lighting.",
  "reasoning": "This update highlights the massive influx of new models (Video/Audio) and the strategic move towards Agents (OpenClaw/Polly), framed in a high-energy, celebratory tone appropriate for Discord.",
