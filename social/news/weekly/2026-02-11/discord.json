  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of the cute bee mascot wearing big pixelated headphones and holding a tiny movie clapperboard. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel peach gradient background. Floating pixel icons of musical notes, film reels, and code blocks surrounding the bee. Chunky retro sprites, warm lighting, lo-fi aesthetic like Stardew Valley. Text in chunky pixel font at the top reads: 'WEEKLY BUZZ'. The bee looks happy and creative. Nostalgic, clean, and readable. Cozy pixel art, 8-bit aesthetic, soft pastel gradients, warm lighting, retro gaming vibes. The main character is a cute pixel art bee mascot with a yellow body and dark brown horizontal stripes, small black legs, two black antennae, black vertical oval eyes, bright pink rectangular blush marks on cheeks, a small happy smile, and small rounded light blue translucent wings.",
  "reasoning": "This update focuses heavily on multi-modal capabilities (Audio/Video/Transcription) which is a major unlock for creators. Merging Docs into Play is a huge UX win that deserves highlighting. The tone remains celebratory and emphasizes 'doing' rather than just 'reading changelogs'.",
