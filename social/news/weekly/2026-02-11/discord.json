  "image_prompt": "Pixel art scene of the cute chubby bee mascot wearing large headphones and mixing music on a retro DJ deck. Floating pixel musical notes and film strips. Cozy 8-bit aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes. Text in pixel font: 'A/V STUDIO'. Nostalgic, creative energy.",
