  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art media studio in a forest clearing. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. The cute pixel art bee mascot wears big pixelated headphones and holds a tiny movie clapperboard. Floating retro RPG inventory panels display chunky text: 'WEEKLY BUZZ', 'LTX-2 VIDEO', 'POLLY CODE', 'ELEVEN MUSIC'. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Nostalgic but beautiful, emotionally warm. Cozy pixel art, 8-bit aesthetic, soft pastel gradients, warm lighting, retro gaming vibes.",
  "reasoning": "This update is heavy on multimedia (video/audio) and developer empowerment (open source bot code). The message groups these logically to show the expanded creative potential. The image uses the 'Weekly Buzz' identity with RPG-style inventory slots to showcase the diverse new tools (video, code, music) in a cohesive, cozy visual.",
