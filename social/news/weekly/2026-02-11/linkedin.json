  "hook": "MOMENTUM UPDATE: 40 PRs merged this week.\n\nWe are moving fast to expand beyond images into a fully multimodal infrastructure. The goal is simple: give developers the best open-source tools to build AI apps without the headache.",
  "body": "Here is what shipped to the Pollinations platform this week:\n\n1. AUDIO STACK COMPLETE → We enabled ElevenMusic with precise duration-based billing and added OVH Whisper for speech-to-text. Whether you are generating soundtracks or transcribing voice, the pipelines are now fully operational.\n\n2. NEXT-GEN VIDEO → Video generation got a major upgrade with the LTX-2 model and Grok Imagine Video integration. The quality and consistency of motion are improving rapidly.\n\n3. AGENT INFRASTRUCTURE → We simplified the setup for autonomous agents. OpenClaw now auto-installs and onboards directly in the setup script. Plus, we open-sourced the code for our own Polly Discord Bot so you can fork and modify it.\n\n4. UNIFIED DEV EXPERIENCE → We merged the Documentation directly into the Play page. You can now test models and read the docs in the same interface. Less context switching, more shipping.\n\nWhy this matters:\nWe are seeing over 500 apps built on our platform. Every efficiency gain we ship ripples out to thousands of end-users immediately.\n\nWe build in the open because we believe the future of AI belongs to the community, not black boxes.",

  "image_prompt": "Pixel art infographic displaying a weekly progress report. Large, chunky pixel headline at the top reads 'WEEKLY SHIP'. Below it, a prominent stat: '40 PRs MERGED'. The visual layout features three pixel-art panels or cards: one showing a musical note (Audio), one showing a film strip (Video), and one showing a robot arm (Agents). The cute bee mascot is wearing large headphones and holding a pixelated clapperboard, directing the scene. Background is a soft lime green (#ecf874) with pastel gradients. The style is cozy, clean, and legible, resembling a retro game status screen. Text must be large and clear.",
  "image_text": "WEEKLY SHIP: 40 PRs MERGED. New Audio & Video Models. Docs Unified.",
  "reasoning": "This post emphasizes velocity (40 PRs) and capability expansion (Audio/Video). The 'Weekly Ship' framing establishes a rhythm of reliability. The image uses the infographic style to convey the volume of work at a glance, catering to LinkedIn's visual-first feed while keeping the cozy brand identity."
