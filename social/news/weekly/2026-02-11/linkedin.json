  "post_type": "milestone",
  "hook": "40 PRs merged in 7 days. We just turned the volume up — literally. \n\nPollinations is no longer just an image generation platform. This week, we became a full-stack multimedia engine.",
  "body": "Speed is our strategy. When new SOTA models drop, we integrate them immediately so developers can build with the bleeding edge without managing the infra.\n\nHere is the breakdown of this week's shipping sprint:\n\n1. VIDEO & AUDIO ARE LIVE\nWe integrated LTX-2 for video generation and ElevenMusic for duration-based audio. We also added OVH Whisper for speech-to-text. Developers can now build apps that see, speak, and listen — all through one API.\n\n2. AGENT INFRASTRUCTURE\nWe released the source code for our Polly Discord bot and shipped the OpenClaw integration. We are laying the tracks for autonomous agents that don't just chat, but actively create media in communities.\n\n3. MODEL VELOCITY\nWe upgraded to Claude 3.5 Opus and added support for Imagen-4, Flux-2-dev, and Grok-video. If it's new and good, it's on Pollinations.\n\n→ THE BIGGER PICTURE\nThe 500+ apps built on our platform are evolving. They are moving from static asset generation to dynamic, multi-modal storytelling. We are building the engine to power them.\n\nWe build in the open. The roadmap is public. The code is yours.\n\nCheck the comments for the full changelog.",

  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art infographic showing a high-tech 'Mission Control' center. Large chunky headline text at the top reads 'MULTIMEDIA UNLOCKED'. Three retro UI panels float in the air displaying: 'LTX-2 VIDEO', 'ELEVEN MUSIC', and 'AGENT INFRA'. The cute bee mascot wears a tiny headset and is sliding a fader on a mixing console. Soft lime green (#ecf874) glow from the screens illuminates the room. Background is a warm pastel gradient. A small pixel signboard in the corner reads 'WEEKLY SHIP'. The scene is detailed, warm, and looks like a retro RPG status screen. Emotional vibe: exciting, productive, high-tech but cozy.",
  "image_text": "MULTIMEDIA UNLOCKED | LTX-2 VIDEO | ELEVEN MUSIC | AGENT INFRA | WEEKLY SHIP",
  "reasoning": "This post signals massive momentum by grouping disparate features (video, audio, agents) into a cohesive narrative about becoming a 'multimedia engine'. It proves the team moves fast (40 PRs) and gives investors/devs a clear reason to pay attention: the platform's capabilities just expanded vertically. The 'Mission Control' visual reinforces the idea of a powerful central engine."
