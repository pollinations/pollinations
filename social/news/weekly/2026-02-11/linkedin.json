  "hook": "THE GAP BETWEEN IDEA AND PRODUCTION JUST GOT SMALLER.\n\nThis week, we merged 40 PRs to turn Pollinations into a full multimedia engine.",
  "body": "It is not just about image generation anymore. We are building the open-source infrastructure for the entire creative stack.\n\nHere is what shipped this week:\n\n1. FULL A/V CAPABILITIES\nWe integrated LTX-2 for video generation and ElevenMusic for high-fidelity audio. You can now generate a video, score it with AI music, and transcribe the dialogue via OVH Whisper — all within the same ecosystem.\n\n2. OPEN SOURCE MOMENTUM\nWe open-sourced the code for our Polly Discord Bot (#8078). If you are building community tools, the blueprint is now yours to fork and modify.\n\n3. SIMPLIFIED DX\nWe merged our Documentation directly into the Play page. No more tab switching. You see the model, you test the prompt, you get the API code instantly.\n\n4. INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES\nFrom upgrading to Claude Opus 4.6 on Bedrock to fixing single-bucket balance deductions, the backend is faster and more reliable.\n\nWhy this matters:\nWe are seeing developers move from single-modal apps (just images) to complex, multi-modal experiences. Our job is to make sure the infrastructure keeps up with their imagination.\n\nWe build in the open so you can build without limits.",

  "image_prompt": "Pixel art infographic showing a multimedia studio dashboard. Large headline text at the top reads 'FULL A/V STUDIO'. Below the headline, three large pixel icons arranged horizontally: a film strip (labeled 'LTX-2 VIDEO'), a musical note (labeled 'ELEVEN MUSIC'), and a document scroll (labeled 'WHISPER STT'). In the center, the cute round yellow bee mascot is wearing headphones and holding a conductor's baton, orchestrating the tools. Background is a soft lime green (#ecf874) and lavender gradient. Bottom text reads '40 PRs MERGED'. The style is cozy 8-bit, clean, and scannable. Warm lighting, retro gaming UI elements. Image must be SELF-EXPLANATORY without caption.",
  "image_text": "FULL A/V STUDIO — LTX-2 VIDEO — ELEVEN MUSIC — WHISPER STT — 40 PRs MERGED",
  "reasoning": "This post emphasizes the expansion from 'image gen' to 'full multimedia', which significantly expands the TAM (Total Addressable Market) and utility for developers. Highlighting 40 PRs and specific model names (LTX-2, ElevenMusic) signals high velocity and technical competence. The 'Open Source' angle with the Discord bot reinforces the community-first brand identity."
