  "body": "The era of single-modality AI apps is over. Developers need a unified interface for text, audio, video, and agents. This week, we built it.\n\nWe significantly expanded the Pollinations platform to support the full creative spectrum:\n\n1. THE COMPLETE AUDIO SUITE\nWe integrated OVH Whisper for speech-to-text, upgraded to ElevenLabs v3 for high-fidelity speech, and added the ElevenMusic model. You can now build apps that listen, speak, and compose music via a single API.\n\n2. VIDEO & IMAGE RENAISSANCE\nWe added support for LTX-2, Imagen-4, Flux-2-dev, and Grok-video. Whether you need hyper-realistic generation or stylized video, the models are live and ready for inference.\n\n3. AGENTS TAKING ROOT\nWe open-sourced our Polly Discord Bot and integrated OpenClaw. This isn't just about generating content—it's about autonomous agents that can act on it.\n\n4. FRICTIONLESS DEV EXPERIENCE\nWe merged our Docs directly into the Play page and redesigned the frontend. The distance between 'reading the docs' and 'shipping your first call' is now zero.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\nWe are not just wrapping models. We are building the open, permissionless infrastructure for the next generation of AI creativity. No gatekeeping. No subscriptions. Just code.\n\nIs your team moving this fast?",

  "image_prompt": "Pixel art infographic showing a weekly summary. Large bold pixel text headline 'THE SHIP LIST'. Below it, a retro checklist board with three checked items: 'Full Audio Suite', 'New Video Models', 'Open Source Agents'. To the right, a large stat '40 PRs' in a bright box. The cute yellow bee mascot is wearing a hard hat and holding a pixel wrench, giving a thumbs up. Background is soft lime green (#ecf874) with pastel lavender gradients. Cozy 8-bit aesthetic, warm lighting, clean and scannable layout for mobile feed.",
  "image_text": "THE SHIP LIST\n- Full Audio Suite\n- New Video Models\n- Open Source Agents\n40 PRs Merged",
  "reasoning": "This post focuses purely on velocity and breadth of capability. By grouping 40 PRs into three distinct 'product pillars' (Audio, Video, Agents), we signal that the platform is maturing into a comprehensive suite, not just a toy. The hook is aggressive but factual, appealing to investors looking for execution. The image reinforces the 'shipping' narrative with a checklist metaphor."
