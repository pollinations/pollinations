  "body": "Shipping velocity is the only metric that matters in open source. This week, our team merged 40 PRs, effectively transforming pollinations.ai from a generation tool into a fully multimodal development platform.\n\nHere is what that looks like in practice:\n\n1. THE AUDIO REVOLUTION\nWe have integrated ElevenMusic for high-fidelity music generation and OVH Whisper for speech-to-text transcription. Developers can now build apps that listen and sing, not just read and write.\n\n2. NEXT-GEN VIDEO\nVideo is the next frontier. We added LTX-2, Grok-Video, and Imagen-4. Whether you are building marketing tools or creative suites, the pipeline is ready.\n\n3. RISE OF THE AGENTS\nWe are moving beyond simple prompts. With the OpenClaw integration and the new Polly Discord Bot source code, we are laying the groundwork for autonomous agents that can navigate the web and interact with communities.\n\n4. UNIFIED DEV EXPERIENCE\nGreat models are useless without great documentation. We merged our Docs directly into the Play page. You can now read the manual and test the API in the exact same interface. Friction removed.\n\nWe are building the most accessible, transparent AI infrastructure on the web. No gatekeeping, just shipping.\n\nCheck the new audio capabilities:",

  "image_prompt": "Pixel art infographic scene titled 'THE WEEKLY BUZZ'. A large retro RPG quest board shows the headline text '40 PRs MERGED'. Below the headline, three pixelated panels display icons: a musical note (Audio), a film strip (Video), and a robot head (Agents). The cute chubby bee mascot is center stage, wearing a construction hard hat and holding a blueprint, looking proud. Background is a soft lime green (#ecf874) and lavender gradient. 16-bit SNES pixel art, Stardew Valley style, chunky sprites, visible pixels, soft pastel gradients, warm lighting. Image must be SELF-EXPLANATORY without reading the caption.",
  "image_text": "THE WEEKLY BUZZ: 40 PRs MERGED - Audio, Video, Agents",
  "reasoning": "This post signals massive platform maturity. By grouping 40 PRs into 'Audio, Video, Agents,' we move the narrative from 'we fixed some bugs' to 'we are building a comprehensive ecosystem.' The hook targets the multimodal trend, and the metric (40 PRs) proves execution speed."
