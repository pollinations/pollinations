  "image_prompt": "[Pixel art dev meme infographic] titled 'WEEKLY WRAP'. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Large chunky pixel headline reads '40 PRs MERGED'. Three retro UI panels displaying: 'Audio Suite', 'LTX-2 Video', 'Open Source Bot'. The chubby bee mascot is wearing large pixel headphones and holding a tiny film slate, looking proud. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Composition optimized for mobile readability. Mood: productive and cozy.",
  "body": "This week we merged 40 PRs, focusing heavily on rounding out media generation capabilities and improving the developer experience.\n\n**Audio & Video**\nWe've integrated OVH Whisper for speech-to-text, added the ElevenMusic model, and upgraded TTS to ElevenLabs v3. On the video side, LTX-2, Imagen-4, Flux-2-dev, and Grok-video are now available. The frontend has been updated with a dedicated UI for these audio workflows.\n\n**Dev Experience & Open Source**\nWe open-sourced the Polly Discord Bot for anyone looking to self-host or modify it. We also merged the documentation directly into the Play page to reduce context switching while building.\n\n**Models**\nClaude has been upgraded to Opus 4.6, and we've added Qwen-character for roleplay use cases.\n\nLet us know if the new audio UI feels intuitive.",
  "reasoning": "The '40 PRs' metric serves as a strong hook for the engineering community, signaling active maintenance. Highlighting specific, high-demand models (LTX-2, Whisper) immediately validates the click. The image uses the 'Weekly Wrap' label to establish a recurring series and visualizes the multi-modal updates (headphones/film slate) to make the abstract code changes concrete."
