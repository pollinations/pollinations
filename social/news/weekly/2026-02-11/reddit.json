  "body": "Another busy week for the repo. We merged 40 PRs, focusing heavily on expanding multimodal capabilities and cleaning up the developer experience.\n\n**Here's what shipped:**\n\n*   **Video Generation:** Added **LTX-2** model support.\n*   **Audio Stack:** Integrated **ElevenMusic** (duration-based billing) and **OVH Whisper** for speech-to-text.\n*   **Agents:** Auto-install support for **OpenClaw** and open-sourced the **Polly Discord Bot** code.\n*   **DX:** Merged the Documentation page directly into the Playground's 'Integrate' section—no more tab switching to find parameters.\n*   **New Models:** Added support for api.airforce models (Imagen 3 & Grok Imagine Video).\n\nAs always, the roadmap is open and driven by what you all build. Let us know if the new audio endpoints behave as expected.",
  "reasoning": "This post adopts a 'patch notes' style that resonates well with developer communities on Reddit. It leads with a high-velocity metric (40 PRs) to establish credibility, then breaks down the updates into skimmable, factual bullets without marketing adjectives. The image reinforces the 'gamified productivity' vibe common in open-source culture."
