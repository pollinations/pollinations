  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art dev meme infographic — retro RPG quest log style. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Headline '39 PRs MERGED' in chunky pixel font. Retro UI panels listing: 'LTX-2 Video', 'ElevenMusic', 'New UI', 'OpenClaw'. Bee mascot wearing a tiny pixel engineer cap holding a wrench. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Readable at mobile size. Nostalgic, clean, informative.",
  "body": "Big week for the repo. We merged 39 PRs focusing on model diversity and frontend consolidation.\n\n**Key Updates:**\n\n*   **New Models:** Added LTX-2 for video generation and ElevenMusic for duration-based audio. We also integrated OVH Whisper for speech-to-text and updated Claude Opus to 4.6.\n*   **UX/UI:** Rolled out a frontend redesign and merged the Documentation directly into the Play page to reduce context switching.\n*   **Infra:** Added auto-installation for OpenClaw agents and shipped new economics dashboards to track usage transparently.\n\nEverything is live and the code is open.",
  "reasoning": "This post adopts a 'changelog' format which performs well on Reddit. It leads with a hard metric (39 PRs) and lists specific technical additions (LTX-2, ElevenMusic) rather than using marketing buzzwords. The tone is strictly peer-to-peer/maintainer."
