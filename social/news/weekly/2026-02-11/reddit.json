  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene — the cute bee mascot wearing oversized headphones sits at a retro mixing desk with a video editing monitor. The monitor glows with a lime green (#ecf874) play button. Chunky pixel headline 'WEEKLY WRAP' floats above. Soft pastel lavender and peach gradient background. Warm lighting, lo-fi aesthetic like Stardew Valley. Bee has pink cheeks and small blue wings. Cozy pixel art, 8-bit aesthetic, soft pastel gradients, warm lighting, retro gaming vibes.",
  "body": "We merged 40 PRs this week, focusing heavily on expanding multimedia capabilities and open-source tooling.\n\n**New Models & Features:**\n*   **Video:** Added LTX-2 video generation support.\n*   **Audio:** Integrated ElevenMusic (duration-based billing) and OVH Whisper for speech-to-text.\n*   **LLMs:** Upgraded claude-large to Opus 4.6 and aligned Gemini-search pricing.\n\n**Open Source & Agents:**\n*   **Polly Bot:** The source code for our Discord bot is now public. Useful reference for anyone building AI-integrated bots.\n*   **OpenClaw:** Initial integration landing page and setup for agentic workflows.\n\n**UX Improvements:**\n*   Merged the Documentation directly into the 'Play' page to reduce context switching while building.\n*   Frontend redesign with better audio support.\n\nAs always, the roadmap is open and feedback is welcome.",
  "reasoning": "High-signal title focuses immediately on the new models (Video/Music) which drive engagement in AI subreddits. The body is structured as a changelog to respect the developer audience's time, avoiding fluff. The image reinforces the 'multimedia' theme while maintaining the cozy, non-threatening brand identity."
