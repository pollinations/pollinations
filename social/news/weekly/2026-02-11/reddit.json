  "title": "Weekly Update: LTX-2 Video, ElevenMusic, and Open Sourced Discord Bot",
  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art dev meme infographic — retro RPG quest log screen floating in a soft focus magical garden. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. The pixelated parchment screen lists 'LTX-2 VIDEO', 'ELEVEN MUSIC', and 'POLLY BOT' in retro font. The cute pixel art bee mascot wears a tiny adventurer's cap and holds a pixel quill, checking off items. Chunky pixel headline at top reads 'WEEKLY LOOT'. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Readable at mobile size. Cozy pixel art, 8-bit aesthetic, soft pastel gradients, warm lighting, retro gaming vibes.",
  "body": "We merged 40 PRs this week. The focus shifted heavily toward multimedia models and agent integration.\n\n**New Models & Features**\n- **Video:** Added LTX-2 and Grok-Video generation.\n- **Audio:** Integrated ElevenMusic (duration-based billing) and OVH Whisper for speech-to-text.\n- **Agents:** Open sourced the Polly Discord Bot and added OpenClaw integration.\n- **Images:** Added Imagen-4 and Flux-2-dev.\n\n**UX & Infrastructure**\n- Redesigned the frontend and merged Docs directly into the Play page for better flow.\n- Upgraded Claude-large to Opus 4.6.\n- Moved the Portkey gateway to a custom domain to resolve timeout issues.\n\nEverything is live on the site and the repo. Let us know if you hit any snags with the new video models.",
  "reasoning": "The 'Quest Log' visual metaphor works perfectly for a weekly wrap-up in a gaming-adjacent dev community. The title is strictly factual, listing the high-interest items (Video/Audio models + Open Source). The body is bulleted for skimmability, separating model updates from infra/UX changes."
