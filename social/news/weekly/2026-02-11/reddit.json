  "reasoning": "This post focuses purely on the 'shipping' aspect which resonates with Reddit's engineering communities. It avoids fluff, lists the specific models added (high signal), and uses the 'Weekly Buzz' framing to establish a consistent update cadence. The image highlights the audio/video theme with the mascot in a studio setting."
