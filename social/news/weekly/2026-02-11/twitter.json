  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art weekly recap infographic — retro RPG quest board. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Large chunky pixel headline 'WEEKLY DROPS'. The cute pixel art bee mascot (yellow/brown stripes, pink blush, blue wings) wears a tiny merchant's cap and points to four wooden quest notices pinned to the board.

Cozy pixel art, 8-bit aesthetic, soft pastel gradients, warm lighting, retro gaming vibes.",
