  "message": "## Weekly Update - 2026-02-15\n\nHey <@&1424461167883194418>! 🐝 The hive has been absolutely buzzing this week. We've merged **27 PRs**, and honestly? The loot drop is legendary. Here is what you can play with right now:\n\n🕵️ **Agents That Surf**\nSay hello to **OpenClaw** integration! Your AI agents can now perform web searches and interact with the internet. One-command agents just got a whole lot smarter.\n\n🎬 **Director Mode Unlocked**\nVideo generation is leveling up with **Grok Image-to-Video** support. We also unified video resolutions, so your creations look crisp no matter the format. Plus, **ElevenLabs Scribe v2** is here to make your audio sound smoother than honey.\n\n🧠 **New Flavors & Roleplay**\nModel collectors, eat your heart out. We've added **GLM-5** for general brilliance and the **Qwen-character** model for our roleplay enthusiasts. The `Polly` API also got an embeddings upgrade, making the platform's brain faster and sharper.\n\n💅 **Quality of Life**\nThe **App Showcase** got a massive UI overhaul (it looks *clean*), and we've merged the Docs directly into the Play page. Less tab switching, more building.\n\nGo break things (creatively). We can't wait to see what you make! 🌸",
  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art RPG 'Quest Complete' screen. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel lavender gradient background. A large pixelated wooden quest board displays the text 'WEEKLY LOOT' in chunky retro font. Three smaller pixel panels hanging from the board read: 'OPENCLAW', 'GROK VIDEO', and 'NEW MODELS'. The cute bee mascot stands proudly in front, wearing a tiny pixelated adventurer's hat and holding a glowing loot bag. Warm lighting, scanlines, lo-fi aesthetic like Stardew Valley. Nostalgic, celebratory, and readable.",
  "reasoning": "This update covers major functional expansions (web-searching agents, video generation) that users can immediately play with. The RPG/Quest Log theme fits the 'leveling up' nature of adding new skills (search) and classes (models) to the platform. The tone is high-energy and highlights the immediate utility of the changes.",
