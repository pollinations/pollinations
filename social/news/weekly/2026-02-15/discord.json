  "message": "Happy weekend <@&1424461167883194418>! The hive has been incredibly busy this week, and we've got some massive honey to share. 🍯✨\n\n## Weekly Update - 2026-02-15\n\n**🦀 OpenClaw Takes Center Stage**\nOpenClaw just leveled up! It's now a first-class citizen with **auto-installation and auto-onboarding**, making it easier than ever to deploy. Plus, we've given it **web search capabilities**, so your agents can now surf the web. The new landing page makes everything cleaner and more accessible.\n\n**🎥 Video Generation: Stabilized & Standardized**\nWe've overhauled the video backend! Expect a **unified resolution system** across models (no more guessing aspect ratios). We also added **image-to-video support for Grok**, migrated Wan to a more stable setup, and added smart fallbacks. Creating moving pictures just got a whole lot smoother.\n\n**🦜 Polly Gets an API**\nOur favorite assistant is growing up! **Polly now has an OpenAI-compatible API service**, meaning you can plug her directly into your existing workflows. She's also smarter with upgraded embeddings and better security against prompt leakage. \n\n**🛠️ Dev Experience & Models**\n- **Docs x Play**: We merged the documentation directly into the Play page 'Integrate' section. Code and docs, living in harmony.\n- **New Models**: Added **ElevenLabs Scribe v2** for top-tier speech-to-text, upgraded GLM to v5, and added Qwen3Guard for safety.\n- **Community Wins**: Welcome 'Nova Defense' and 'Convince the CRAZY Idol' to the app showcase! 🎮\n\nKeep building, keep blooming. See you in the showcase! 🌸",
  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of the cute bee mascot standing in front of a retro RPG quest board made of wood and vines. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel peach gradient background. The board has a chunky pixel header text reading 'WEEKLY BUZZ'. Three smaller wooden panels hanging below read 'OPENCLAW', 'POLLY API', and 'VIDEO 2.0'. The bee mascot (yellow/brown stripes, pink blush, blue wings) is wearing a tiny adventurer's cap and pointing at the board with a happy expression. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Cozy pixel art, 8-bit aesthetic, soft pastel gradients, warm lighting, retro gaming vibes. Nostalgic but beautiful.",
  "reasoning": "This update highlights major structural improvements (OpenClaw, Polly API) that empower developers, while keeping the tone light and celebratory. The image prompt reinforces the 'Weekly Update' theme using a familiar RPG quest board metaphor, fitting the cozy gaming aesthetic perfectly.",
