VIDEO GENERATION STABILIZED\nWe unified the resolution system across models and migrated Wan video. We also added Grok image-to-video support and Alibaba DashScope fallbacks. The result? More reliable video generation for your apps, with fewer failed requests.\n\n2. OPENCLAW IS NOW NATIVE\nOpenClaw (our open-source agent framework) received a massive overhaul. It now supports auto-installation, auto-onboarding, and web search models. We are moving from 'experimental' to 'production-ready' for autonomous agents.\n\n3. POLLY GROWS UP\nOur internal assistant, Polly, now exposes an OpenAI-compatible API service. This means you can drop Polly into existing workflows that expect standard LLM endpoints. We also hardened security against prompt leakage.\n\n4. UNIFIED DEV EXPERIENCE\nWe merged the Documentation directly into the Play page. No more tab switching—code, test, and read docs in one single view.\n\nOpen source moves fast. We move faster.",

The board has a wooden header that reads 'WEEKLY BUILD LOG' in chunky pixel text. Pinned to the board is a large paper with the headline '27 PRs MERGED'. Below the headline, three smaller pixel-art sticky notes read: 'VIDEO 2.0', 'OPENCLAW', and 'POLLY API'. The cute bee mascot is wearing a tiny carpenter's tool belt and holding a pixelated hammer, looking proud of the work. Background is a soft gradient of lime green (#ecf874) and pastel mint. Warm, cozy lighting like Stardew Valley. High quality, clear text.",

  "reasoning": "This post uses the 'Milestone' angle to demonstrate sheer velocity. By grouping 27 PRs into three understandable buckets (Video, Agents, API), we translate code churn into product value. The image uses the 'Weekly Build Log' concept to establish a recurring content series that looks like a game update, fitting the retro aesthetic while conveying serious progress.",
