  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art RPG inventory screen scene. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. The cute pixel art bee mascot (yellow body, brown stripes, pink blush, small blue wings) is wearing a tiny merchant backpack and checking a floating retro UI quest board. The board has a chunky pixel text header 'WEEKLY LOG'. Three smaller retro panels below list: 'OPENCLAW', 'UNIFIED VIDEO', and 'POLLY API'. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Nostalgic, clean, readable text. Cozy pixel art, 8-bit aesthetic, soft pastel gradients, warm lighting, retro gaming vibes.",
  "body": "This week saw 27 PRs merged, focusing on stabilizing video generation and elevating OpenClaw.\n\n**OpenClaw Integration**\nOpenClaw is now a first-class citizen with auto-installation and onboarding support. We've added web search capabilities and a dedicated landing page with a tabbed UI to streamline the experience.\n\n**Unified Video & Models**\nWe standardized the video resolution system and migrated the Wan model. Grok-video now supports image-to-video, and we added fallbacks for Wan via Alibaba DashScope. On the text side, GLM was upgraded to version 5, and we added Qwen3Guard 8B for safety.\n\n**Polly API & DevEx**\nPolly now offers an OpenAI-compatible service (`polly-api`), making it easier to drop into existing workflows. We also merged the Documentation directly into the Play page's Integrate section to reduce context switching.\n\nFull changelog is on GitHub.",
  "reasoning": "The post strips away marketing fluff and categorizes the 27 PRs into three distinct engineering themes (OpenClaw, Video, API/DevEx). This respects the developer audience's time while highlighting the significant architectural improvements. The RPG inventory image metaphor gamifies the progress report in a way that aligns with the brand's cozy, community-driven identity.",
