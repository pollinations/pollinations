  "message": "Hey <@&1424461167883194418>! Hope your weekend is off to a cozy start. 🐝\n\n## 🌸 Weekly Update - 2026-02-16\n\nWe've been busy bees building tools to help you build better. Here's the fresh honey from this week:\n\n**🦞 OpenClaw Meets Pollinations**\nThe autonomous agent framework **OpenClaw** just got the full Pollinations treatment! We've shipped a new landing page, auto-onboarding scripts, and fresh branding. It's never been easier to spin up your own AI agents and let them roam free.\n\n**🎭 New Model: Qwen Character**\nStorytellers and roleplayers, this one's for you. We've added `qwen-character` to the text roster—it's optimized for deep personality consistency and narrative flow. (We also did some spring cleaning and removed the unstable flux-2-dev).\n\n**📚 Docs 🤝 Playground**\nWhy switch tabs when you can just scroll? We've merged the **Docs** directly into the **Play page**. Now you can grab integration code and test it immediately in the same window. Maximum flow state unlocked.\n\n**🛡️ Polly Power-Up**\nWe've hardened our resident AI, Polly, against prompt leakage. She's just as friendly as ever, but much better at keeping secrets and staying secure.\n\nGo build something magical! 🌸",
  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of the cute bee mascot standing in front of a wooden RPG quest board in a sunny digital garden. The board displays three retro parchment notices with chunky pixel text: 'OPENCLAW', 'QWEN CHAR', and 'LIVE DOCS'. A large wooden sign above reads 'WEEKLY BUZZ'. The bee wears a tiny adventurer's cape and holds a pixelated map. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Chunky retro sprites. Nostalgic, emotionally warm, celebratory atmosphere.",
  "reasoning": "This update balances a major integration (OpenClaw) with immediate user value (new models, better UX). The 'Weekly Buzz' RPG quest board theme fits the gamified/community vibe of Discord perfectly.",
