  "caption": "The Weekly Buzz is here! 🐝✨ We've been busy bees in the code garden this week. \n\nHere’s the tea on what shipped:\n\n🦾 **OpenClaw Integration:** The claw has landed! We’ve got a shiny new landing page, auto-setup scripts, and full branding. It’s never been easier to get started.\n\n📚 **Docs x Playground:** Why switch tabs? We merged the Docs right into the Play page. Read and build at the same time. Big brain energy. 🧠\n\n🛡️ **Polly Hardening:** We gave our girl Polly a shield upgrade. Better security against prompt leakage means safer creating for everyone.\n\n✨ **New Models:** Swapped out the unstable stuff for the shiny new Qwen-character model.\n\nSwipe to see the full quest log! Which update are you most hyped for? 👇\n\n#pollinations #opensource #weeklybuzz #pixelart #gamedev #indiedev #aiart #buildinpublic #cozyvibes #techupdate",
