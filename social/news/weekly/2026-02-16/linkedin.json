  "hook": "BUILDING THE OPEN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR AI AGENTS.\n\nThe best developer tools don't exist in a vacuum — they integrate.",
  "body": "This week, we merged 7 PRs focused on connecting Pollinations with the broader agentic ecosystem and refining our developer experience.\n\nHere is what shipped:\n\n1. OPENCLAW INTEGRATION\nWe launched a dedicated landing page and streamlined the setup script. It now includes auto-onboarding and full branding support. If you are building autonomous agents, the friction just dropped to near zero.\n\n2. UNIFIED DEV EXPERIENCE\nContext switching kills flow. We merged our Documentation directly into the 'Play' page. You can now read the docs and test the API in the same window.\n\n3. SMARTER EXECUTION\nUpdated our gateway to support Gemini's executable code blocks. The models aren't just generating text anymore — they are writing and running code.\n\n4. SECURITY HARDENING\nWe tightened 'Polly' against prompt leakage. Open source means transparent, not vulnerable.\n\nWe are seeing 500+ apps built on our platform because we treat developers as partners, not just users.\n\nAre you building agents or just chatting with bots?",

  "image_prompt": "Pixel art infographic scene showing a wooden 'Quest Board' in a cozy village square. Large pixel headline at the top of the board reads 'WEEKLY SHIP'. A sub-header on the board reads 'OPENCLAW & DX'. Three paper notes pinned to the board list features: 'OpenClaw Setup', 'Docs in Playground', and 'Code Execution'. The cute bee mascot is wearing a tiny yellow builder's hard hat and holding a pixel hammer, adding a new note to the board. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Text must be large, chunky, and readable. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic.",
  "image_text": "WEEKLY SHIP: OpenClaw Integration, Docs in Playground, Code Execution",
  "reasoning": "This post focuses on 'infrastructure' and 'integration', which appeals to serious developers and investors looking for platform maturity. The 'OpenClaw' update signals that Pollinations is becoming a hub for agents, not just a generation API. The image uses the 'Quest Board' metaphor to visualize the weekly progress in a gamified, community-centric way."
