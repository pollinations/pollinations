  "title": "Weekly Update: OpenClaw integration, Qwen-Character, and merging Docs into the Playground",
  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene — a retro RPG quest board in a sunny village square. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. The cute pixel art bee mascot wears a tiny adventurer's cap and checks off items on the board. She has a yellow body, dark brown stripes, and translucent blue wings. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. A wooden board displays chunky pixel text: 'WEEKLY LOG'. Smaller pinned notes read: 'OPENCLAW', 'LIVE DOCS', 'SECURITY'. Nostalgic but beautiful, emotionally warm.",
  "body": "We merged 7 PRs this week. The biggest change is the full integration of OpenClaw—including a new landing page and auto-setup scripts. We also swapped out the unstable Flux-2-dev model for Qwen-character to improve reliability.\n\nOn the DX front, documentation is now live directly inside the Playground, so you don't have to context switch while testing parameters. Finally, we hardened Polly against prompt leakage and updated the gateway for better Gemini code execution.\n\nCode is open on GitHub as always. Let us know what you think.",
  "reasoning": "Focuses on shipping velocity and concrete technical improvements (OpenClaw, DX, security) rather than marketing hype. The RPG quest board visual fits the 'completing tasks' theme of a weekly update and appeals to the gaming-adjacent dev crowd."
