  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art RPG quest board scene. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. Center: a wooden pixel art notice board with a large parchment headline 'WEEKLY BUILD'. Pinned quests/notes read: 'OPENCLAW', 'LIVE DOCS', 'QWEN-CHAR'. The cute bee mascot (wearing a tiny pixel tool belt) is pinning a new note to the board. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Detailed, chunky sprites. Cozy pixel art, 8-bit aesthetic, soft pastel gradients, warm lighting, retro gaming vibes.",
  "reasoning": "Highlights the major integration (OpenClaw) and UX improvement (Docs in Play) which are high-value for builders. The 'Weekly Build' image concept reinforces the consistent shipping cadence.",
