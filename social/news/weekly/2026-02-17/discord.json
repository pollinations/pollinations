  "message": "Happy Tuesday, <@&1424461167883194418>! 🌸\n\nThe hive has been absolutely buzzing this week. We’ve been cooking up something special to help you move from just *generating* content to *automating* it. If you've been waiting for a sign to start building agents, this is it.\n\n## 🌸 Weekly Update - 2026-02-17\n\n**🦞 Pollinations Meets OpenClaw**\nThe big news: **OpenClaw integration is live!** We’ve bridged the gap between our generative tools and autonomous agent infrastructure. You can now access a dedicated landing page and comprehensive docs to get started. This opens up a massive playground for developers wanting to build smart, self-directed bots using our open-source ecosystem.\n\n**⚡ Zero to Agent in Seconds**\nWe know that configuration headaches are the enemy of creativity. We fixed that.\n*   **Auto-Magic Setup:** We shipped a new setup script that auto-installs OpenClaw for you.\n*   **Instant Onboarding:** The script handles the configuration automatically.\nIt’s essentially a speed-run button for your dev environment. Less time wrestling with dependencies, more time building cool stuff.\n\n**✨ Fresh Paint & Polish**\nYour tools should feel as good as they work. We’ve overhauled the OpenClaw branding with a cohesive look—updated favicons, clean logos, and readable fonts. It’s a smoother, cozier experience from the moment you load the page.\n\nGo forth and pollinate the web with your new agents! 🐝💨",
  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of the cute bee mascot high-fiving a friendly, floating mechanical claw robot (OpenClaw). Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel peach gradient background. Chunky retro sprites. Text in pixel font at the top reads: 'WEEKLY BUZZ'. The bee has pink blush marks and small blue wings. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Celebratory confetti pixels floating in the air. Cozy pixel art, 8-bit aesthetic, soft pastel gradients, warm lighting, retro gaming vibes.",
  "reasoning": "This update focuses heavily on the new OpenClaw integration, which is a significant functional expansion for users (Agents). The message highlights the 'ease of use' (auto-install) to encourage adoption, while the image visualizes the partnership between the mascot and the new tool (the claw) in a friendly, non-intimidating way.",
