We translate the technical 'OpenClaw integration' into a visual metaphor of the Bee meeting a Claw Machine/Robot to make it approachable. The 'Auto-install' feature is visualized as instant magical growth (nature metaphor), and the 'Branding fix' is shown as polishing/cleaning, keeping the vibes cozy and domestic rather than technical.",
