  "title": "Weekly Update: OpenClaw integration, Gemini code execution, and Qwen-Character",
  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of a retro arcade claw machine labeled 'OPENCLAW'. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. The cute pixel art bee mascot (yellow/brown stripes, pink blush, blue wings) is wearing tiny pixelated mechanic goggles and operating the joystick. The claw is lifting a glowing lime green (#ecf874) code block. Chunky pixel headline at the top reads 'WEEKLY WRAP'. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley. Nostalgic but beautiful, emotionally warm.",
  "body": "We merged 7 PRs this week focusing on agent integration and model reliability.\n\n**OpenClaw Integration**\nWe've added auto-setup and integration for OpenClaw. This allows for better autonomous agent workflows directly within the platform.\n\n**Model Updates**\n* **Qwen-Character**: Added support for Qwen-character to provide more variety in roleplay and character-based generation.\n* **Gemini Code Execution**: Fixed an issue where Gemini was failing to execute generated code blocks properly. This is now stable.\n\n**UX Improvements**\nWe merged the documentation directly into the Play page. You can now reference API parameters and prompt guides without context-switching between the app and the docs site.\n\nAs always, the code is open and available on GitHub.",
  "reasoning": "The post focuses on the technical integration of OpenClaw which is high-interest for developers, while grouping the maintenance updates (Gemini fixes, Docs merge) as practical improvements. The tone remains objective and peer-to-peer, avoiding marketing fluff about the pricing changes."
