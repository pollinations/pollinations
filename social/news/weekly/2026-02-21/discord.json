  "message": "Hey <@&1424461167883194418>,\n\n## Weekly Update - 2026-02-21\n\n48 PRs merged this week. The hive has been busy renovating the foundations and planting new seeds. Here is what happened:\n\n**🎨 App Showcase & Community**\n- **Showcase Renovation:** The App Showcase now supports proper Markdown descriptions, better metrics, and a cleaner UI. Your apps look better than ever.\n- **Badge System:** Introduced a proper badge system. BYOP is officially rebranded to **Pollen**.\n- **Build Diary:** Added an interactive diary to the Community page so you can visualize the history of what we are building.\n\n**🤖 Polly & Infrastructure**\n- **OpenAI Compatibility:** Added `polly-api`, an OpenAI-compatible interface for Polly. Drop it into your existing workflows.\n- **Auto Polly:** Deployed a self-healing repo agent. It fixes itself so we don't have to.\n- **NPM Update:** Moved packages to the `@pollinations_ai` scope. Please update your imports.\n\n**✨ Models & New Apps**\n- **Safety:** Added Qwen3Guard 8B.\n- **New Apps:** A massive harvest including **SlidePainter**, **Nova Defense**, and **BrainrotMaker** (we don't judge, we just host).\n\nInfrastructure is open, code is fresh. Go build something weird.",
  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of a wooden quest board standing in a lush digital garden. The board features a chunky pixel header text reading 'WEEKLY LOG'. Three smaller wooden signboards hanging below read 'OPENAI API', 'APP SHOWCASE', and 'AUTO POLLY'. Polly the bee (yellow/brown stripes, pink blush, blue wings) is hovering while pinning a new note to the board, wearing tiny builder goggles. The Monitor Robot stands nearby holding a stack of pixelated papers, screen glowing lime green (#ecf874). Soft lime green and pastel lavender gradient background. Warm lighting, lo-fi Stardew Valley aesthetic. Nostalgic, clean, and information-dense.",
  "reasoning": "Highlights the structural improvements (API, Showcase) that affect developers most, while keeping the tone grounded and community-focused. The image prompt uses the RPG quest board metaphor to visualize the 'Weekly Update' concept in a cozy, gamified way.",
