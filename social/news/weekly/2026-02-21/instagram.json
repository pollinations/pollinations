The garden is growing.\n\nWe renovated the App Showcase (it actually looks good now), taught Polly to speak OpenAI, and deployed a self-healing agent to fix our own messy code. Also moved our NPM packages to a proper home and added a visual Build Diary because text logs are boring.\n\nNew community apps include SlidePainter and... BrainrotMaker. You're welcome.\n\nCode is open. Go build something.\n\n#pollinations #opensource #generativeai #pixelart #weeklyupdate #indiedev #buildinpublic #creativecoding",
