  "image_prompt": "Cozy pixel art scene of a wooden quest board standing in a lush digital garden. The board has a chunky pixel header text 'BUILD LOG'. Pinned to the board are three distinct papers with legible pixel text: 'OPENAI API', 'SHOWCASE UI', and 'AUTO AGENT'. Polly the bee (cute pixel mascot, yellow/brown stripes, pink blush, small blue wings) is hovering next to the board holding a tiny red thumbtack. A lime green (#ecf874) lantern hangs from the side, casting a warm glow. Soft pastel gradient background (mint to peach). 8-bit aesthetic, chunky sprites, Stardew Valley interface vibes. High contrast text.",
  "body": "We merged 48 PRs this week. The most useful addition for developers is `polly-api` (#8234), which exposes an OpenAI-compatible endpoint. If you have existing tooling or agents that speak OpenAI, you can now point them at our infrastructure without rewriting your client code.\n\nThe App Showcase received a significant renovation. We added markdown support for descriptions, improved the metrics UI, and implemented a proper badge system. We also rebranded the credit system from 'Bring Your Own Prompts' to simply 'Pollen' to stop confusing everyone.\n\nHousekeeping note: We've moved our npm packages to the `@pollinations_ai` scope. The old packages are deprecated but will function for a while; please update your dependencies when you can.\n\nOther shipments include 'Auto Polly' (a self-healing repo agent), the Qwen3Guard safety model, and an interactive Build Diary on the community page. As always, the code is open.\n\nCheck the repo: https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations",
  "reasoning": "Title puts the most technically relevant feature first. Body focuses on utility (compatibility) and breaking changes (NPM scope) rather than marketing fluff. Tone is dry and maintenance-focused.",
