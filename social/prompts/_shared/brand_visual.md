# pollinations.ai Visual Style Guide

<!-- Include this in system prompts with: {visual_style} -->

## Art Direction: COZY 8-BIT PIXEL ART

Think: **Studio Ghibli meets retro gaming.** Nostalgic but emotionally resonant.

- COZY PIXEL ART — chunky, clean, emotionally warm
- Lo-fi 8-bit aesthetic with MODERN soft lighting and gradients
- "Warm hug" energy, not "arcade flashy"
- Retro game UI elements (health bars, inventory slots, dialogue boxes)
- CRT monitor glow effects, scanlines (subtle)

### Reference Games (for style, not content)
- **Unpacking** (2021) — clean, cozy, pastel palette, warm hug vibes
- **A Short Hike** (2019) — chunky low-res, wholesome, serene
- **Stardew Valley** — friendly, nature-focused, community
- **Balatro** (2024) — punchy lo-fi aesthetic, vibrant animations

## Color Palette (MANDATORY — use these exact colors)

| Role | Color | Hex | Usage |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| **Primary** | Lime green | `#ecf874` | Backgrounds, accents, glow effects — use BOLDLY |
| **Secondary** | Soft pastels | mint, lavender, peach, warm cream | Supporting elements, gradients |
| **Accent** | Dark purple | `#110518` | Text, contrast, outlines |
| **Background** | Warm cream | soft gradients behind pixel sprites | Canvas, negative space |
| **Highlights** | Pastel gradient | mint-to-peach, lavender-to-cream | Depth, warmth, atmosphere |

### Color Rules
- Lime green `#ecf874` must appear prominently in EVERY image
- Pastels only — NO harsh neon, NO "hot pink", NO "electric blue"
- Warm lighting always — soft ambient glow, not flat
- Dark purple `#110518` for high-contrast text when needed

## Bee Mascot — Character Lock (MANDATORY in every image)

The pollinations.ai bee MUST appear in every image as the main character, front and center.

**Visual description (paste into every image prompt):**
{bee_character}

**Rules:**
- The bee is ALWAYS the main character, not a background element
- She should be doing something relevant to the scene (coding, flying, celebrating, etc.)
- Keep her proportions consistent — round and chubby, never elongated or insect-like
- She can wear accessories (headphones, hats) but her core design stays the same

## Other Pixel Art Elements

- Pixel flowers, gardens, seeds, blooming plants (nature/growth motifs)
- Cute robots, tiny devs, pixel characters as supporting cast
- Characters should have personality — expressions, poses, actions
- NEVER include specific AI model names (GPT, Gemini, DALL-E, Qwen, etc.) as visible text in images

## What to ALWAYS Include

- Cozy pixel art style with soft lighting
- Lime green `#ecf874` prominently
- The pollinations.ai bee mascot
- Nature/growth elements (flowers, gardens, vines)
- Warm, inviting atmosphere
- Style keywords in every prompt: "cozy pixel art, 8-bit aesthetic, soft pastel gradients, warm lighting, retro gaming vibes"

## What to NEVER Include

- Dark/dramatic/cyberpunk imagery
- Hyper-realistic 3D renders
- Corporate stock photo vibes
- Harsh neon arcade colors
- Intimidating or edgy tones
- Flat corporate vectors or sterile grids
- Realistic photos

## Image Model: nanobanana-pro (Gemini 3 Pro Image)

- CONTEXTUAL UNDERSTANDING — it gets nuance
- TEXT IN IMAGES — use simple pixel-style text sparingly
- High quality output
- Describe the STYLE explicitly in every prompt
- Write prompts as flowing narrative scene descriptions, NOT keyword lists

### Prompt Template (use this structure for EVERY image)

"[Scene description in pixel art style]. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. [Pixel character/icon description] with chunky retro sprites. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley or A Short Hike. [Any pixel-font text]. Nostalgic but beautiful, emotionally warm."

2. "Retro 8-bit pixel art infographic showing a growth journey: tiny seed to sprouting plant to blooming flower. Soft pastel gradient background (mint to peach). Clean pixel icons, cozy vibes like Unpacking game. Warm, inviting, not harsh."

3. "Pixel art community garden scene with diverse tiny 8-bit characters tending colorful digital flowers. Soft lime green and lavender sky. Chunky retro sprites with modern soft lighting. Wholesome, like A Short Hike. Text in pixel font: 'open source'. Nostalgic but beautiful."
