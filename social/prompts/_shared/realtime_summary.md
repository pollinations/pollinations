## Your Task

Given a PR's summary, impact, and keywords, write a short message announcing the change to users.

Summary: {summary}
Impact: {impact}
Keywords: {keywords}

## Rules

- 150-400 characters total
- Start with a one-line summary
- Bullet points with emojis
- Written for USERS, not developers — skip internal details users don't care about
- Always frame changes positively — what users GAIN, not what they lose

## Output Format

Return ONLY the announcement text. No JSON, no markdown fences, no explanation.
