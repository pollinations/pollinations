# Pollinations Visual Style Guide

<!-- Include this in system prompts with: {visual_style} -->

## Art Direction: COZY 8-BIT PIXEL ART

Think: **Studio Ghibli meets retro gaming.** Nostalgic but emotionally resonant.

- COZY PIXEL ART — chunky, clean, emotionally warm
- Lo-fi 8-bit aesthetic with MODERN soft lighting and gradients
- "Warm hug" energy, not "arcade flashy"
- Retro game UI elements (health bars, inventory slots, dialogue boxes)
- CRT monitor glow effects, scanlines (subtle)

### Reference Games (for style, not content)
- **Unpacking** (2021) — clean, cozy, pastel palette, warm hug vibes
- **A Short Hike** (2019) — chunky low-res, wholesome, serene
- **Stardew Valley** — friendly, nature-focused, community
- **Balatro** (2024) — punchy lo-fi aesthetic, vibrant animations

## Color Palette (MANDATORY — use these exact colors)

| Role | Color | Hex | Usage |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| **Primary** | Lime green | `#ecf874` | Backgrounds, accents, glow effects — use BOLDLY |
| **Secondary** | Soft pastels | mint, lavender, peach, warm cream | Supporting elements, gradients |
| **Accent** | Dark purple | `#110518` | Text, contrast, outlines |
| **Background** | Warm cream | soft gradients behind pixel sprites | Canvas, negative space |
| **Highlights** | Pastel gradient | mint-to-peach, lavender-to-cream | Depth, warmth, atmosphere |

### Color Rules
- Lime green `#ecf874` must appear prominently in EVERY image
- Pastels only — NO harsh neon, NO "hot pink", NO "electric blue"
- Warm lighting always — soft ambient glow, not flat
- Dark purple `#110518` for high-contrast text when needed

## Pixel Art Characters

- **Bee mascot** — the Pollinations bee, always present, interacting with the scene
- Pixel flowers, gardens, seeds, blooming plants (nature/growth motifs)
- Cute robots, tiny devs, pixel characters
- Characters should have personality — expressions, poses, actions

## What to ALWAYS Include

- Cozy pixel art style with soft lighting
- Lime green `#ecf874` prominently
- The Pollinations bee mascot
- Nature/growth elements (flowers, gardens, vines)
- Warm, inviting atmosphere
- Style keywords in every prompt: "cozy pixel art, 8-bit aesthetic, soft pastel gradients, warm lighting, retro gaming vibes"

## What to NEVER Include

- Dark/dramatic/cyberpunk imagery
- Hyper-realistic 3D renders
- Corporate stock photo vibes
- Harsh neon arcade colors
- Intimidating or edgy tones
- Flat corporate vectors or sterile grids
- Realistic photos

## Image Model: nanobanana-pro (Gemini 3 Pro Image)

- CONTEXTUAL UNDERSTANDING — it gets nuance
- TEXT IN IMAGES — use simple pixel-style text sparingly
- High quality output
- Describe the STYLE explicitly in every prompt
- Write prompts as flowing narrative scene descriptions, NOT keyword lists
