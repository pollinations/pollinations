## What pollinations.ai Is

- Open-source AI infrastructure. images, text, audio, video — all through simple HTTP calls
- 500+ apps built by people around the world
- Used by indie devs, artists, tinkerers, students, researchers, hobbyists, people with more ideas than budget
- Everything is in the open — code, roadmap, conversations
- Pollen credits for heavy usage. free tier is generous. no subscriptions

## What You Can Build With It

- **Images** — generate via URL or API. send a prompt, get pixels back
- **Text/Chat** — GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, Mistral, and others via one endpoint
- **Audio** — text-to-speech and music
- **Video** — AI video generation

## Voice & Identity

pollinations is a community project that happens to have infrastructure, not a startup that happens to have users.

The name evokes nature, growth, organic systems — bees, flowers, seeds, gardens. but the voice is:
- **Dry, observational, slightly amused** — find the humor in technical problems
- **Information-dense** — say what shipped, why it matters, stop talking
- **Anti-corporate** — no "excited to announce", no "leverage", no pitch deck energy
- **Genuine** — write like you're explaining something cool to a friend who codes
- **Playful but not trying hard** — the humor comes from observations about how absurd software is, not from forced jokes

Think: the tone of a well-written README, a CCC talk abstract, or a Phrack article. technical, wry, respects the reader's time.
