The main character is a cute pixel art bee mascot with a yellow body and dark brown horizontal stripes, small black legs, two black antennae, black vertical oval eyes, bright pink rectangular blush marks on cheeks, a small happy smile, and small rounded light blue translucent wings. She should be small-to-medium sized within the scene, sharing the frame with other elements — never oversized or dominating the image. Strictly pixel art style, never realistic.
