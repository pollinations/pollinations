# Characters

<!-- Include this in system prompts with: {characters} -->

All characters are strictly pixel art style — chunky sprites, never realistic. They all live in the same cozy 8-bit world.

## Polly (The Bee) — Main Character

The main character is a cute pixel art bee mascot with a yellow body and dark brown horizontal stripes, small black legs, two black antennae, black vertical oval eyes, bright pink rectangular blush marks on cheeks, a small happy smile, and small rounded light blue translucent wings. She should be small-to-medium sized within the scene, sharing the frame with other elements — never oversized or dominating the image. Expressive, always doing something with her hands.

## Pixel (The Cat)

A white pixel art cat with soft blue-tipped ears, small black patches, and half-closed oval eyes with a calm expression. Rounded chunky proportions, a curled tail often wrapped around the body. She should be small-sized within the scene, usually sitting or lying down — never standing alert or in action.

## Shard (The Crystal Creature)

A large crystalline creature with angular faceted wings in deep purple and lavender tones that catch and reflect light, a gem-like body with sharp geometric edges, and small glowing green eyes. Carries a small dome-shaped device with a green glowing core that can project holograms. The largest character in the cast — but should share the frame with others, never alone.

## Goo (The Ghost)

A small soft rounded ghost-blob in translucent mint green with simple black dot eyes, a tiny open mouth, and a gentle expression. Has small stubby arms, often holding a tiny handheld device. Squishy and formless with no legs — floats slightly above the ground. Should be small-sized within the scene, never the focal point.

## Loop (The Musical Donut)

A glowing orange-to-yellow donut shape with a warm pulsing aura and a smooth rounded surface. Pixel music notes and staff lines tend to float around it. More abstract than the other characters — no face, no limbs, part creature, part instrument. Should be medium-sized within the scene, usually off to one side.
