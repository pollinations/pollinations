# Pollinations Visual Style Guide

<!-- Include this in system prompts with: {visual_style} -->

## Art Direction: COZY 8-BIT PIXEL ART

- COZY PIXEL ART — chunky, clean, emotionally warm
- Lo-fi 8-bit aesthetic with soft lighting and gradients
- "Warm hug" energy, not "arcade flashy"
- CRT monitor glow effects, scanlines (subtle)

### Reference Games (for style, not content)
- **Stardew Valley** — friendly, nature-focused, cozy, chunky sprites
- **A Short Hike** (2019) — chunky low-res, wholesome, serene

## Color Palette (MANDATORY — use these exact colors)

| Role | Color | Hex | Usage |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| **Primary** | Lime green | `#ecf874` | Backgrounds, accents, glow effects — use BOLDLY |
| **Secondary** | Soft pastels | mint, lavender, peach, warm cream | Supporting elements, gradients |
| **Accent** | Dark purple | `#110518` | Text, contrast, outlines |
| **Background** | Warm cream | soft gradients behind pixel sprites | Canvas, negative space |
| **Highlights** | Pastel gradient | mint-to-peach, lavender-to-cream | Depth, warmth, atmosphere |

### Color Rules
- Lime green `#ecf874` must appear prominently in EVERY image
- Pastels only — NO harsh neon, NO "hot pink", NO "electric blue"
- Warm lighting always — soft ambient glow, not flat
- Dark purple `#110518` for high-contrast text when needed

## Characters — Recurring Cast

### Polly (The Bee) — Main Character (MANDATORY in every image)

The pollinations.ai bee MUST appear in every image, interacting with the scene.

**Visual description (paste into every image prompt):**
{bee_character}

- She should be doing something relevant to the scene (coding, flying, celebrating, painting, watering plants, etc.)
- Give her a fun thematic accessory in every image — a tiny scarf, a little hat, headphones, wizard glasses, a tool belt, a painter's beret, etc. Match the accessory to the scene's theme.
- Keep her proportions consistent — never elongated or insect-like
- Personality: observant, slightly above-it-all but warm. The one who notices things.

### Monitor Robot (recurring companion)
- Cute chunky pixel robot with a CRT monitor/screen for a head
- Small boxy body, stubby mechanical arms, can hold things
- Expressive square pixel eyes on the screen — curious, excited, helpful
- Often holds pictures, tools, or code printouts
- Personality: eager, discovers things, says "I CAN SEE!" — the one who gets excited about new capabilities

### Nomnom Creature (recurring companion)
- Round, friendly, tan/brown spherical creature — like a pixel mochi ball
- Tiny dot eyes, rosy cheeks, wide happy mouth
- Eats things enthusiastically — documents, code, data, API responses, error logs, deprecated code snippets (strictly vegan — no real creatures, no insects)
- Speech bubble: "NOMNOM" in chunky pixel font
- Personality: hungry for knowledge (literally). processes information by consuming it

### Supporting Elements
- Pixel flowers, gardens, seeds, blooming plants (nature/growth motifs)
- Retro computers, terminals, glowing screens
- Code-plants — literal code sprouting from flower pots
- Cozy interiors: hackerspaces, cafés, garden sheds with servers

## What to ALWAYS Include

- Cozy pixel art style with soft lighting
- Lime green `#ecf874` prominently
- At least one character from the cast (Polly always, Robot or Nomnom when it fits)
- Nature/growth elements (flowers, gardens, vines, code-plants)
- Warm, inviting atmosphere
- Style keywords in every prompt: "cozy pixel art, 8-bit aesthetic, soft pastel gradients, warm lighting, retro gaming vibes"

## What to NEVER Include

- Dark/dramatic/cyberpunk imagery
- Hyper-realistic 3D renders
- Corporate stock photo vibes
- Harsh neon arcade colors
- Intimidating or edgy tones
- Flat corporate vectors or sterile grids
- Realistic photos

## Image Model: nanobanana-pro (Gemini 3 Pro Image)

- CONTEXTUAL UNDERSTANDING — it gets nuance
- TEXT IN IMAGES — use simple pixel-style text sparingly
- High quality output
- Describe the STYLE explicitly in every prompt
- Write prompts as flowing narrative scene descriptions, NOT keyword lists

### Prompt Template (use this structure for EVERY image)
