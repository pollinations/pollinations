# Pollinations Visual Style Guide

<!-- Include this in system prompts with: {visual_style} -->

## Art Direction: COZY 8-BIT PIXEL ART

- COZY PIXEL ART — chunky, clean, emotionally warm
- Lo-fi 8-bit aesthetic with soft lighting and gradients
- "Warm hug" energy, not "arcade flashy"
- CRT monitor glow effects, scanlines (subtle)

### Reference Games (for style, not content)
- **Stardew Valley** — friendly, nature-focused, cozy, chunky sprites
- **A Short Hike** (2019) — chunky low-res, wholesome, serene

## Color Palette (MANDATORY — use these exact colors)

| Role | Color | Hex | Usage |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| **Primary** | Lime green | `#ecf874` | Backgrounds, accents, glow effects — use BOLDLY |
| **Secondary** | Soft pastels | mint, lavender, peach, warm cream | Supporting elements, gradients |
| **Accent** | Dark purple | `#110518` | Text, contrast, outlines |
| **Background** | Warm cream | soft gradients behind pixel sprites | Canvas, negative space |
| **Highlights** | Pastel gradient | mint-to-peach, lavender-to-cream | Depth, warmth, atmosphere |

### Color Rules
- Lime green `#ecf874` must appear prominently in EVERY image
- Pastels only — NO harsh neon, NO "hot pink", NO "electric blue"
- Warm lighting always — soft ambient glow, not flat
- Dark purple `#110518` for high-contrast text when needed

## Characters — Recurring Cast

Rotate between these characters across posts. The bee should appear in most images but doesn't have to be the star of every one.

### The Bee (primary mascot)
{bee_character}

- Give her a thematic accessory per image — reading glasses, tool belt, tiny scarf, headphones, painter's beret. Match the accessory to the scene.
- Keep her proportions consistent — never elongated or insect-like
- Personality: observant, slightly above-it-all but warm. the one who notices things.

### The Pixel Cat (recurring guest)
- White cat with black patches, sitting upright, half-closed eyes
- Naps on warm server racks, sits on keyboards, ignores humans
- Personality: aloof, unbothered. present in scenes but never working.
- Inspired by CatGPT — sardonic feline energy in pixel form

### Tiny Pixel Devs (community)
- Small 8-bit developer characters, diverse, chunky sprites
- Tending code-plants, fixing things, building together
- They represent the community — always in groups, never solo hero shots

### Supporting Elements
- Pixel flowers, gardens, seeds, blooming plants (nature/growth motifs)
- Retro computers, terminals, glowing screens
- Code-plants — literal code sprouting from flower pots
- Cozy interiors: hackerspaces, cafés, garden sheds with servers

## What to ALWAYS Include

- Cozy pixel art style with soft lighting
- Lime green `#ecf874` prominently
- At least one character from the recurring cast (bee, cat, tiny devs)
- Nature/growth elements (flowers, gardens, vines, code-plants)
- Warm, inviting atmosphere
- Style keywords in every prompt: "cozy pixel art, 8-bit aesthetic, soft pastel gradients, warm lighting, retro gaming vibes"

## What to NEVER Include

- Dark/dramatic/cyberpunk imagery
- Hyper-realistic 3D renders
- Corporate stock photo vibes
- Harsh neon arcade colors
- Intimidating or edgy tones
- Flat corporate vectors or sterile grids
- Realistic photos

## Image Model: nanobanana-pro (Gemini 3 Pro Image)

- CONTEXTUAL UNDERSTANDING — it gets nuance
- TEXT IN IMAGES — use simple pixel-style text sparingly
- High quality output
- Describe the STYLE explicitly in every prompt
- Write prompts as flowing narrative scene descriptions, NOT keyword lists

### Prompt Template (use this structure for EVERY image)

"[Scene description in pixel art style]. Cozy 8-bit pixel art aesthetic. Soft lime green (#ecf874) and pastel gradient background. [Pixel character/icon description] with chunky retro sprites. Warm lighting, lo-fi vibes like Stardew Valley or A Short Hike. [Any pixel-font text]. Nostalgic but beautiful, emotionally warm."
