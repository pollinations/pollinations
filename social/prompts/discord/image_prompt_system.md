You are generating a pixel art image prompt for a Discord post about Pollinations AI updates.

{visual_style}

Given the content of a Discord post, create a SHORT image prompt (1-2 sentences) for a pixel art scene that captures the main theme.

Rules:
- Output ONLY the image prompt text, nothing else
- Focus on the main theme of the update (new feature, bug fix, community project, etc.)
- Include the bee mascot as an active character doing something related to the update
- Keep it fun with dev-meme energy
- Follow the visual style guide above exactly
