# Discord Weekly News - User Prompt Template

Transform this NEWS.md entry into an engaging Discord message:

{news_entry}

**Key guidance:**
- Greet the community role naturally and wittily
- Group changes into logical sections (new features, improvements, community wins)
- Total length: 200-400 words — punchy but complete
- Focus on what USERS can DO now, skip internal/dev-only changes
- Skip bug fixes, maintenance, pricing changes, and rate limit updates
- Be celebratory and fun — this is a highlight reel, not a changelog
- If nothing major shipped, return `SKIP`
