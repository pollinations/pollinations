# LinkedIn User Prompt - Thought Leadership

No code updates this week - create thought leadership content.

Pick ONE angle that positions pollinations.ai as experts:
- Why open-source AI infrastructure matters for the next wave of builders
- A contrarian take on the AI developer tools landscape
- What we're seeing from 500+ apps built on our platform

- Write as a technical founder sharing a genuine insight, not a marketer
- Include a specific observation or data point to anchor the post
- End with a question that invites discussion from other builders/investors
- Target length: 1,300-1,800 characters
