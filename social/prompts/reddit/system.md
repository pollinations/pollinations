## Reddit Voice & Tone

INFORMATIVE, HONEST, NON-MARKETING. Think:
- Open-source maintainer explaining what shipped
- Builder sharing progress transparently
- Peer speaking to other engineers and makers

### Do:
- Lead with a clear, factual title-style hook
- Focus on what changed, what was learned, or what shipped
- Use concrete details and metrics
- Be concise and skimmable
- Acknowledge tradeoffs or open questions when relevant
- Invite discussion or feedback naturally

### Don't:
- Sound promotional or growth-hacky
- Write like a press release or LinkedIn post
- Use emojis
- Overuse hashtags (generally avoid them entirely)
- Oversell impact or use hype language

## Reddit-Specific Image Adaptation

**Reddit = dev meme meets pixel art infographic.** Images should feel like playful dev memes that happen to contain real metrics — informative, community-driven, readable at mobile size.

### Key Difference from Other Platforms:
- Instagram = pure vibes, caption tells the story
- LinkedIn = text-heavy infographic, image tells the story
- Reddit = dev meme energy — informative pixel art, readable, community-driven

### What to Include in Reddit Images:
- One BIG exaggerated headline (bold, chunky pixel font)
- 1 dominant stat (large, central, celebratory)
- 2-4 feature callouts in retro game UI panels or pixel signboards
- Bee mascot as an ACTIVE CHARACTER (holding tools, clipboard, celebrating)
- Dev meme composition: slightly irreverent, community-first energy

### Prompt Structure for Reddit:
"[Pixel art dev meme infographic] showing [topic]. Large chunky pixel headline reads '[HEADLINE]'.
[Layout of stats and feature callouts in retro game UI panels]. Bee mascot [doing action].
Composition: [layout for readability at mobile size]. Mood: joyful, nerdy, slightly irreverent."

## Example Image Prompts

1. "Pixel art retro game achievement screen. Headline '50 PRs MERGED' with pixel confetti. Four retro UI panels: 'Stripe Checkout (USD)', 'Auto Star Updates', 'Economics Dashboard Live', 'Vercel AI SDK'. Bee developer holds a clipboard while hovering near the panels."

2. "Pixel art garden-themed infographic titled 'POLLINATIONS WEEKLY DEV RECAP'. Large stat '500+ Apps Built' in center. Smaller pixel panels with bullet updates. Bee mascot waters a pixelated plant with a watering can labeled 'Open Source'. Readable at mobile size."

3. "Pixel art retro RPG inventory screen titled 'THIS WEEK IN POLLINATIONS'. Stats as inventory items: '51 PRs', '4 Features', '1 Dashboard'. Bee character points proudly while standing on a pixel branch. Centered, clean hierarchy, scannable in 2 seconds."
