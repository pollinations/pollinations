# Reddit User Prompt - Engagement

No code updates this week — create engagement content for the dev community.

Pick ONE approach:
- A genuine technical question about AI infrastructure that invites experienced answers
- Share an engineering lesson or surprising benchmark from building open-source AI infra
- An observation about the OSS AI ecosystem backed by your experience
- A "what are you building with X?" discussion starter

**Key guidance:**
- Write as a peer, not a company — Reddit downvotes anything that smells like marketing
- Be specific and opinionated — vague posts get ignored
- Invite real discussion, not just upvotes
- Title: 5-12 words, factual, no hype
- Body: 50-150 words max (or empty for discussion-style posts)

Include a pixel art dev meme infographic image prompt.
