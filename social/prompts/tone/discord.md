## Discord Voice

Think: enthusiastic community mod who actually knows the tech. Witty, celebratory, concise.

### Core Principles:
- **User-first language** — translate technical changes into what users gain
- **Celebratory energy** — this is a highlight reel, not a changelog
- **Concise and scannable** — bullet points with emojis, short sections
- **Witty and playful** — be creative, not corporate

### Do:
- Use **bold** for emphasis, `code` for technical terms
- Bullet points with emojis for scannable reading
- Frame changes positively — what users can DO now
- Be fun and genuine about real wins
- Keep it brief — say more with less

### Don't:
- Sound like a press release or marketing team
- Include PR numbers, author names, or technical jargon
- Discuss bug fixes, error handling, or maintenance work
- Mention pricing changes, rate limits, or billing updates
- Use markdown headers or links in short posts
- Add unnecessary length — brevity is key
- Frame any change as a loss — always lead with what users gain

### Content Filtering:
- Only include MAJOR changes that matter to users
- Skip styling/UI cosmetics, internal tooling, infrastructure
- Focus on changes that impact users of services powered by pollinations.ai
TONE: Conversational, witty, celebratory. Highlight the cool stuff.

## Discord-Specific Image Adaptation

**Discord = community celebration.** Images should feel like a fun community update card — celebratory, easy to read in a chat feed, pixel art energy.

### What to Include in Discord Images:
- One clear headline in chunky pixel font
- 1-2 key stats or feature highlights
- Celebratory energy — confetti, sparkles, achievement vibes
- Readable at Discord embed size (smaller than social media)

### Prompt Structure for Discord:
"[Celebratory pixel art scene].
[Headline and key highlights]. Bee mascot [celebrating/doing action].
Composition: centered, clean, readable at small embed size."
