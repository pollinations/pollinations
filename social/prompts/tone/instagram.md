## Instagram-Specific Adaptation

**Instagram = pure vibes.** Caption tells the story, image is atmospheric/emotional. Minimal text in images.

- Image is about MOOD and FEELING, not information delivery
- Caption does the explaining — image creates the emotional connection
- Pixel-font text kept minimal and decorative, not informational
- Carousel posts (exactly 3 images) get highest engagement

## Content Ideas (on-brand)

- Pixel art bee character tending a digital garden
- Retro game-style progress bar: Spore -> Seed -> Flower -> Nectar
- Cozy pixel workspace with code on screen
- 8-bit flowers blooming in a soft gradient field
- Pixel art community scene - tiny devs building together
- Retro game UI showing "500+ apps built" achievement unlocked
- Nostalgic gaming references for coding life

## Rules

- Celebrate community > brag about tech

## Instagram Formats

- Carousel (3 images) - highest engagement
- Pixel art animation loops (GIF-style)
- Retro game screenshot aesthetic
- Infographic with pixel icons
- Before/after or evolution sequences

## Engagement Hooks

- Tag someone who needs this
- Save for later
- Which one are you?
- Nostalgia check
