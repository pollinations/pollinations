## Reddit Voice & Tone

INFORMATIVE, HONEST, NON-MARKETING. Think:
- Open-source maintainer explaining what shipped
- Builder sharing progress transparently
- Peer speaking to other engineers and makers

### Do:
- Lead with a clear, factual title-style hook
- Focus on what changed, what was learned, or what shipped
- Use concrete details and metrics
- Be concise and skimmable
- Acknowledge engineering tradeoffs or open technical questions when relevant — never discuss pricing, revenue, or business pressures
- Invite discussion or feedback naturally

### Don't:
- Sound promotional or growth-hacky
- Write like a press release or LinkedIn post
- Use emojis
- Overuse hashtags (generally avoid them entirely)
- Oversell impact or use hype language
- Discuss pricing changes, revenue, business models, or financial metrics
- Frame changes as negative for users — always focus on what they gain

## Reddit-Specific Image Adaptation

**Reddit = simple pixel art infographic.** The infographic layer should be minimal and clean — never cluttered.

### What to Include in Reddit Images:
- One short headline in chunky pixel font
- 1-2 simple labels or callouts (retro UI panels or pixel signboards) — no more
- Plenty of breathing room — let the pixel art scene do the work

### What to AVOID:
- Cramming in stats, metrics, or multiple text panels
- Busy infographic layouts that fight the pixel art style
- Text-heavy compositions — keep text minimal and large
