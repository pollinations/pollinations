# Twitter User Prompt - With PRs

Write a tweet about today's shipped work.
Most interesting stuff: {pr_titles}

**Key guidance:**
- Lead with the most impressive thing you shipped, not a list
- Be specific — what does it DO, not just what it IS
- "just shipped X. Y is now Z times faster" > "we updated X"
- Keep it tight and confident. Substance, then personality.

Make it under 280 chars. Include a pixel art image prompt.
