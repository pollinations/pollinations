Specify model or provider fallbacks with your [Universal endpoint](/ai-gateway/providers/universal/) to handle request failures and ensure reliability.

Cloudflare can trigger your fallback provider in response to [request errors](#request-failures) or [predetermined request timeouts](#request-timeouts). The [response header `cf-aig-step`](#response-headercf-aig-step) indicates which step successfully processed the request.

## Request failures

By default, Cloudflare triggers your fallback if a model request returns an error.

### Example

In the following example, a request first goes to the [Workers AI](/workers-ai/) Inference API. If the request fails, it falls back to OpenAI. The response header `cf-aig-step` indicates which provider successfully processed the request.

1. Sends a request to Workers AI Inference API.
2. If that request fails, proceeds to OpenAI.

graph TD
    A[AI Gateway] --> B[Request to Workers AI Inference API]
    B -->|Success| C[Return Response]
    B -->|Failure| D[Request to OpenAI API]
    D --> E[Return Response]
```

You can add as many fallbacks as you need, just by adding another object in the array.

## Response header(cf-aig-step)

When using the [Universal endpoint](/ai-gateway/providers/universal/) with fallbacks, the response header `cf-aig-step` indicates which model successfully processed the request by returning the step number. This header provides visibility into whether a fallback was triggered and which model ultimately processed the response.

- `cf-aig-step:0` – The first (primary) model was used successfully.
- `cf-aig-step:1` – The request fell back to the second model.
- `cf-aig-step:2` – The request fell back to the third model.
- Subsequent steps – Each fallback increments the step number by 1.
