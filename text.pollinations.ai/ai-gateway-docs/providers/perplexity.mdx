### Use Perplexity through OpenAI SDK with JavaScript

Perplexity does not have their own SDK, but they have compatibility with the OpenAI SDK. You can use the OpenAI SDK to make a Perplexity call through AI Gateway as follows:

```js title="JavaScript"
import OpenAI from "openai";

const apiKey = env.PERPLEXITY_API_KEY;
const accountId = "{account_id}";
const gatewayId = "{gateway_id}";
const baseURL = `https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/${accountId}/${gatewayId}/perplexity-ai`;

const perplexity = new OpenAI({
	apiKey,
	baseURL,
});

const model = "mistral-7b-instruct";
const messages = [{ role: "user", content: "What is Cloudflare?" }];
const maxTokens = 20;

const chatCompletion = await perplexity.chat.completions.create({
	model,
	messages,
	max_tokens: maxTokens,
});
```
